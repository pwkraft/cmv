\section{Basic Rules on the Subreddit ChangeMyView}\label{app:rules}

Below is a summary of the set of rules to participate in discussions on \texttt{/r/ChangeMyView} as described in April 2018. The current rules can be viewed at \url{https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules}

\paragraph{Rules for submission of new discussion posts:}
\begin{enumerate}[A]\singlespacing
\item Explain the reasoning behind your view, not just what that view is (500+ characters required).
\item You must personally hold the view and demonstrate that you are open to it changing.
\item Submission titles must adequately sum up your view and include "CMV:" at the beginning.
\item Posts cannot express a neutral stance, carry a risk of personal endangerment, be self-promotional, or discuss this subreddit (visit r/ideasforcmv instead).
\item Only post if you are willing to have a conversation with those who reply to you, and are available to start doing so within 3 hours of posting.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Rules for commenting in existing discussions:}
\begin{enumerate}[1]\singlespacing
\item Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPâ€™s stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question.
\item Don't be rude or hostile to other users.
\item Refrain from accusing OP or anyone else of being unwilling to change their view.
\item Award a delta if you've acknowledged a change in your view. Do not use deltas for any other purpose.
\item Comments must contribute meaningfully to the conversation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Excluding Non-political Discussions}\label{app:political}

For the purpose of this paper, I decided against filtering out subsets of discussions based on their thematic (or political) relevance since such a strategy could raise additional concerns about potential selection bias. However, it is worth exploring whether the substantive results are robust when focusing only on discussions revolving around politics. In the following, I therefore replicate all major analyses of the paper after excluding discussions related to distinctly non-political topics (e.g., ``Food'' or ``Entertainment''). The following figure shows the total number of discussions that focus on political versus non-political issues (based on the LDA results).
