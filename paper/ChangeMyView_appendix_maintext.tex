\section{Basic rules on CMV}

\paragraph{Submission rules:}
\begin{enumerate}[A]\singlespacing
\item Explain the reasoning behind your view, not just what that view is (500+ characters required).
\item You must personally hold the view and demonstrate that you are open to it changing.
\item Submission titles must adequately sum up your view and include "CMV:" at the beginning.
\item Posts cannot express a neutral stance, carry a risk of personal endangerment, be self-promotional, or discuss this subreddit (visit r/ideasforcmv instead).
\item Only post if you are willing to have a conversation with those who reply to you, and are available to start doing so within 3 hours of posting.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Comment rules:}
\begin{enumerate}[1]\singlespacing
\item Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPâ€™s stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question.
\item Don't be rude or hostile to other users.
\item Refrain from accusing OP or anyone else of being unwilling to change their view.
\item Award a delta if you've acknowledged a change in your view. Do not use deltas for any other purpose.
\item Comments must contribute meaningfully to the conversation.
\end{enumerate}
