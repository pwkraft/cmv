It remains particularly unclear whether failed elite attempts at persuasion simply leave citizens' attitudes unchanged or whether such attempts at persuading one segment of the electorate can actually lead to a loss of support in others. This study therefore investigates partisan cues and the occurrence of contrast effects, i.e. when the presence of an elite cue induces citizens to shift their attitudes away from the viewpoint advocated in a persuasive message. Based on data from three experiments involving two different party leader cues, I demonstrate that partisan cues can trigger contrast effects among those perceiving the party leader in question as non-likeable and those who vote for a party which is politically opposed to the source. The implications of the findings are discussed.},

Three hypotheses
1) Partisan polarization
2) redistricting
3) incumbency - growing advantage of incumbency 

No support for redistricting – the number of safe and marginal seats did not change before or after redistricting happened. 

Most of the movement happened between redistricting – this is support for the partisan polarization hypothesis – Republicans are increasingly surrounded by Republicans – Democrats are increasingly surrounded by Democrats. More representatives represent districts which strongly favor one party based on presidential vote and also presidential vote is more correlated with congressional vote. 

Support for increase in incumbency – competition (as measured by percentage won with less than 60 percent) has stayed about the same for open seats while it has decreased for incumbent seats. 

Much of the change in the incumbency effect is a change in the spending advantage of incumbents – once spending and district partisanship is taken into account the direct effect of incumbency ahs been decreasing.

The effect of campaign spending has stayed the same, but incumbents now have a much bigger spending advantage than they used to. This along with increasing partisan poliarzation are the two main cuase of the increase in the safeness of congressional elections.},

- narrowing of the gap b/w number of democrats and republicans increases polarization (?) 
- party identity is supposed to be important and stable 
- but: there have been changes! 
- realignment doesn't really fit, there was moderate, graduate change that affected election results 
- Reagan and Clinton -> policies were polarizing
-> Argue that there has been a shift in general support for each of the parties with more people beginning to support the Republicans. This shift is a result of increasing polarization between the two parties making it easier for individuals to choose a party based on their policy preferences.
-> Voters are more aware of differences in party issues positions, and this knowledge means voters are more likely to choose a party based on issue positions. 
 
Summary:
1994 landslide by Republicans was the culmination of a secular realignment that had been occurring for several election cycles prior to the victory. The increasing polarization of the two parties made it easier for people to choose a party based on their issue positions. In the south, there was a substantial amount of intergenerational shift from democratic parents to Republican kids. Correlation between PID and ideology increases from 1978 to 1994. The realignment was due to ideology affecting pid not pid affecting ideology. Theffect of 92 ideology on 94 PID was much stronger than the effect of 92 PID on 94 ideology. Conservatives raised by DEM parents were abandon the party of their parents and flocking to the GOP.},

- Partisan polarization is largely an elite phenomenon
- Not big differences between red and blue states
- Social cleavages have not overtaken economic cleavages
- Growing polarization turns off voters

Moderation counterevidence:
- Ideological identification has polarized in the mass public over time
- Correlations between issues has increased
- The increase in polarization has been concentrated among the most educated and engaged

Partisan polarization:
- increase in correlation between ideology and PID
- increase in partisan polarization of presidential evaluation

Social cleavages:
- correlation between religiosity and PID has been increasing

Participation:
- polarized feelings toward Bush increase participation},

It is this possibility that represents the major costs of dishonesty -for dishonest dealings tend to drive honest dealings out of the market. [...] The cost of dishonesty, therefore, lies not only in the amount by which the purchaser is cheated; the cost also must include the loss incurred from driving legitimate business out of existence." governmental intervention may increase welfare of all parties - as such, dishonesty in business is a serious problem in underdeveloped countries --> greater quality variation/low gov't capacities - e.g. credit markets in underdeveloped countries --> personal knoledge/connection necessary (or easy means of enforcing the contract) --> Counteracting institutions (gov't): guarantees, brand-name goods, chains, licensing practices --> overcome informational asymmetry, trust problem},

- cooperation can lead to better outcomes

Subsequent chapters: 
- historical (institutional) perspective on how the 2-party system emerged 
- e.g. during foundation: discussion about where the capital should be, whether to have a federal bank... 
- parties grew out of different factions concerning the role of the gov't -> early development of party system / fierce party competition

Chapter 8: The critical era of the 1960s why are there so few toss-up seats? why is there polarization?

- primary process -> primary challenges can lead to polarization -> MoC pushed out to the extremes

  comment   = {Parties are not expected to have an influence all the time, only under certain circumstances. The effects of party are asymmetric in that the majoirity party gains more power while the minority party does not gain power.
- Majority advantage in committee construction 
-> majority parties emphasize the appointment of loyalists to important committees and let self-selection rule on the rest 
-> majority parties have the most bonus seats on the important committees and more bonus seats when the house is closely divided. 
- Ability to override seniority for committee chairs -> this was done to be responsive to the party and by doing this it increased the power of the majority party.
- Holding votes open until the majority party can get what they want -> get someone to switch a vote
- Majority party has control over more resources so has more of a ability to promise reward or punishment. -> committee chairmanships or rewards on later legislation.
- Control of the Rules committee among most important power of majority party -> influences agenda

Conditions for CPG:
- Preference homogeneity: Party members will delegate when they have similar preferences
- Preference conflict: members of majority have more incentive to delegate power if parties differ from each other. 

Summary:
This is a more updated version of CPG. Majority uses its powers to create partisan legislative packages that other members only need to tolerate. If this is not enough, the majority can use agenda tools to achieve partisan outcomes directly (without the necessity of member support). Some strategies majority parties use to exploit asymmetric differences include: inducement (bonus seats, side payments, favorable committee appointment), conspiracy (because the majority controls agenda certain bills can be left off if they might tarnish your reputation), and contextual self interest (rules packaged together that full members might not pass alone). Majority does not try to implement these tactics if they could potentially win without them.

questions/comments:
- should read this more carefully with fight between Krehbiel and these guys
- Deals with Mayhew: mayhew was writing when parties were weak. Can't explain power delegation that occurred.},

Results show that the shares of spending on productive public goods-education, roads, sewers and trash pickup-in U.S. cities (metro areas/urban counties) are inversely related to the city's (metro area's/county's) ethnic fragmentation, even after controlling for other socioeconomic and demographic determinants.

summary:
- Political attitudes are highly genetically transmitted. PID has a lower genetic component than other attitudes, backing up the common assumption that PID is a identity handed down by parents to their kids. 
- They emphasize the interaction between social environments and genetic influences and these should be part of the models of political attitude formation.
- “Genes do not work in isolation and instead generally influence the extent to which organisms are responsive to particular environmental conditions.”
- Genetics (about half) more powerful than shared environment (11 percent) for overall measure of conservatism.
- “Genes influence people’s broad outlook and personalities, and it is these broad features that then predispose individuals toward suites of specific attitudes.”
- Observe broad but distinct political phenotypes. – absolutist and contextualist. (pg 164-165 for fuller definition of each)},

To assess the bias introduced by information effects, I compare ``fully informed{''} collective preferences simulated from actual survey data to collective preferences revealed in the original data. Analysis of policy questions from the 1988 and 1992 American National Election Studies shows that group differences in knowledge, along with the public's modest average level of political knowledge, cart cause significant distortions in measures of collective opinion. The mass public may appear more progressive on some issues and more conservative on others than would be the case if all citizens were equally well informed. To the extent that opinion polls influence democratic politics, this suggests that information effects can impair the responsiveness of governments to their citizens.},
  comment     = {overview:
- how would full information affect policy preferences of the electorate?
-> information effect as the bias in the shape of collective opinion caused by low levels and uneven distribution of political knowledge
-> deviations in representation based on sociodemographics/interests X knowledge
-> measure of collective/public opinion is biased, such that the public appears more progressive on some issues and more conservative on others
- results somewhat challenge the notion of rational collective preferences through on-line processing, heuristic shortcuts, and statistical aggregation as ways to overcome lack of political knowledge
- however, the information effects differ by policies and are not as profound as early studies on citizen incompetence might suggest (e.g. Converse etc)

data/methods:
- ANES 1988 and 1992
- simulate/impute collective policy preferences under hypothetical full information in the entire electorate -> see Bartels 1996, Delli Carpini/Keeter 1996
- imputation through modeling interactions b/w sociodemographic variables and political knowledge as determinants of policy preferences, simulate predicted values if knowledge was maximized for entire electorate

results:
- fully informed preferences are sometimes more liberal and sometimes more conservatie than actual preferences
- some asymmetries in representation due to lack of information are bigger than previous studies suggested, but deviations depend on the specific policy
- "The key contribution of this study lies not with speculating about the public's true interests but with demonstrating that survey results sometimes look the way they do because so many people are ill-informed about politics and because certain people tend to be better informed than others."

questions/comments:
- a little bit more skeptical than page and shapiro
- how consequential are the informational asymmetries in terms of policy outcomes?},

- liberals -> greater neurocognitive sensitivity to cues for altering a habitual response pattern
- theoretical argument: political orientation is associated with neurocognitive mechanisms involved broadlly in self-regulation
-> self-regulatory process of conflict monitoring
=> "We proposed that differences in conservativesï¿½ and liberalsï¿½ responsiveness to complex and potentially conflicting information relates to the sensitivity of this general mechanism for monitoring response conflict."

method:
- electroencephalographs while performing Go/No-Go Task
- 2 measures: error-related negativity (ERN) + No-Go N2 component

results:
- liberalism was associated withgreater conflict-related neural activity when reponse-inhibition was required
- liberalism -> greater accuracy on No-Go trials
- conservatism -> greater persistence in habitual response pattern
=> "Taken together, our results are consistent with the view that political orientation, in part, reflects individual differences in the functioning of a general mechanism related to cognitive control and self-regulation. Stronger conservatism (versus liberalism) was associated with less neurocognitive sensitivity to response conflicts."

summary:
- Did a task where people had a habitual response but were occasionally needed to note when something new happened. This is related to the process of conflict monitoring or for detecting when one’s habitual response tendency is mismatched with responses required by the current situation. And has been associated with brain activity in the anterior cingulated cortex. 
- Liberals were more accurate in the Go/No Go task and also had more brain activity in the specified area when response inhibition was required.
- More conservative orientation is related to greater persistence in a habitual response patter. Liberalism is associated with greater neuro-cognitive sensitivity to cognitive conflict. 

questions / comments:
- conservatism and liberalism not manipulated, no controls... -> what about willingness to comly etc.? could that explain the patterns as well?
- (un)related thoughts: environment interaction? differences in neurocognitive activation patterns might be subject to individual interpretation of context etc. -> not innate differences b/w lib con but rather display different reactions to environment...},

  abstract  = {Much attention has been paid to the effects of political efficacy and trust on political participation. Most studies tend to use efficacy or trust as an independent variable to explain political actions such as voting, campaign involvement, and the like. Despite their importance in explanations of political behavior, relatively little is known regarding mechanisms through which social involvement may influence trust and efficacy. If efficacy and trust are of value, then it is important that we determine how their development can be fostered, and especially whether their development can be promoted through social interaction-such as a sense of community. Borrowing from the field of community psychology, I employ the Sense of Community Index to provide a more nuanced measure of community based on individual perceptions of their community that previous studies were unable to capture. Analyzing original survey data, this paper examines to what extent, if any, a sense of community matters for trust and efficacy. The results demonstrate that social forces, such as community, exert positive and significant effects on internal and external efficacy and personal and political trust, independently of individual traits such as income, age, gender, and education.},

Each survey utilized a nearly identical questionnaire soliciting information across a range of political and social indicators, many of which can be validated with government data. Comparing the findings from the modes using a Total Survey Error approach, we demonstrate that a carefully executed opt-in Internet panel produces estimates that are as accurate as a telephone survey and that the two modes differ little in their estimates of other political indicators and their correlates.},

There are three main effects. First, the better candidate adopts more centrist policies than the worse candidate. Second, the equilibrium is statistical, in the sense that it predicts a probability distribution of outcomes rather than a single degenerate outcome. Third, the equilibrium varies systematically with the level of uncertainty about the location of the median voter. We test these three predictions using laboratory experiments and find strong support for all three. We also observe some biases and show that they can be explained by quantal response equilibrium.},

- comparison of matching methods (exact and inexact matches) and experimental results (using instrumental variables / 2sls)
- result: matching estimates are similar to OLS estimates in this scenario: they yield biased results, don't take into account selection process etc.

study scenario:
- phone GOTV study
- single household members were assigned to T and C randomly
- compliance / contact rate relatively low -> systematic selection
- estimation via matching or based on IV -> ATT
- IV showed no effect, but OLS and matching suggests that there was a significant positive effect of GOTV phone calls
-> bias in matching is increased if the sample includes individuals with unlisted phone numbers
-> matching estimates sensitive to changes in contact rates

conclusion:
- compared to OLS, matching relaxes the linear functional form assumption
- but: matching only produces biased on observed covariates, not on anything else -> what about unobserved causes of DV?
-> matching still makes the assumption of interchangeability of reachable and non-reachable individuals -> doesn't overcome selection problem

question:
- could the IV result be inefficient because the first-stage regression is a weak predictor of receiving the treatment (since contact rates in the treatment group are relatively low)},

  volume    = {29},
  number    = {3},

  comment   = {Motivations:
Undecided voters introduce problems in accurately forecasting elections because their preferences are essentially unaccounted for. Although some voters explicitly claim no preference for a candidate they might hold unspoken inclinations (i.e., implicit attitudes). If implicit attitudes exist, can be measured, and demonstrate predictive power over actual voting behavior it might be possible to make more precise electoral forecasts by accounting for those who claim to be undecided between candidates. 
-> Can implicit measures of candidate preferences predict actual voting behavior?

Assumptions:
- Attitudes are conceived as object-evaluation associations
- Efficiency of automatic retrieval of the evaluation depends on the strength of the associative links
- The stronger the association (measured by the speed of retrieval) the greater the influence on subsequent cognitive processes and behaviors.

Hypotheses:
Undecided voters display implicit preferences for candidates that are capable of predicting voting behavior. The IAT is a valid tool for measuring these implicit preferences.

Study 1: Aims to validate the IAT
- Approximately one month before the Italian General Election (2001) individuals completed an IAT assessing their relative preference for Silvio Berlusconi (right-wing) or Francesco Rutelli (left-wing), IAT used both pictures and words for each candidate along with negative and positive words
- A week after the General Election individuals were contacted and asked who they actually voted for
- Researchers created a Diat* index of preference for each candidate based on the mean latencies for the experimental IAT trials
- Diat index is based on Greenwald et al 2003. Takes into account several different aspects of performance, including mean response latency in two critical phases, no. of errors, and overall variability.
-> Findings: IAT results for individuals who were (explicitly) committed in their candidate preference significantly predicted their actual vote choice at p<.001. IAT results for individuals who were (explicitly) undecided among candidates significantly predicted their actual vote choice at p<.05. 

Study 2: Aims to further explore the relationship between implicit attitudes and undecided voters
- Approximately one month before Veneto local elections (2005) individuals completed an IAT assessing their relative preference for Giancarlo Galan (right-wing) and Massimo Carraro (left-wing), IAT used pictures for each candidate. Only subjects who reported to be undecided between candidates performed the test (n=58).
- After the local elections individuals (n=51) returned a questionnaire to the researchers indicating their actual vote choice.
- Researchers created a Diat index of preference for each candidate based on the mean latencies for the experimental IAT trials
-> Findings: Results indicated that measures of implicit attitudes significantly predicted actual vote selection among those individuals who explicitly claimed to be undecided.

Take home message: 
Implicit attitude measures, like the IAT, can pick up on underlying preferences even when individuals do not explicitly express such inclinations. More importantly, implicit attitude measures are capable of predicting behavioral outcomes.

Class discussion: 
- The results of this study suggest that even when one is not consciously aware of a preference it still exists. In light of this, should we ever believe that an individual can genuinely be politically undecided or independent? 
- The authors assessed implicit attitudes approximately one month before the election? How far can we push the link between implicit attitudes and voting behavior? Three months prior? Six months prior?},

- effect of embeddedness is much stronger for right-wing and moderate identifiers than those who lean towards the left

question: 
- H3: shouldn't it be stated the other way round: ideology has less of an effect in societies with high embeddedness? from a causal perspective: is it the macro- or the micro effect that is moderated? 
- theoretical argument implies a moderation b/w values and ideology -> welfare attitudes 
- but: wouldn't it make more sense to think of an mediation similar to the Schwartz et al. 2010 result: values -> ideology -> welfare attitudes -> does their argument really display a reasonable causal mechanism?},

  comment   = {overview:
- makes 3 general arguments against interpreting implicit attitude measures (affective priming and IAT) necessarily as prejudice
- propose cultural stereotypes as major alternative mechanism behind the observed patterns (as compared to association or response competition mechanism)

1) implicit measures could reveal shared cultural stereotypes rather than personal predisposition
- IAT varies by perception of cultural stereotypes, minority groups show similar patterns etc.

2) affective negativity measured could also indicate other negative emotions such as shame or guilt and not necessarily prejudice or endorsement
- shame and embarassement as negative emotions that have similar effects as anger and hostility
- validity tests looking at eyeblink frequency, amygdala activity, and slumped posture could be explained by these alternative negative emotions

=> associative or attitudinal explanation?

3) patterns of judgment can be interpreted as rational behavior
- expected utility theory, attribution error/discounting principle, bayesian inference/bayes rate error, as well as fast and frugal heuristics can explain the same patterns due to actual correlations b/w minority groups and crime etc.
- in other contexts, these deviations from bayesian principle is viewed as an error, but in the context of race, the accurate application would be viewed as prejudice

0) other concerns:
- IAT results do not necessarily measure stable predispositions but can be context-dependent

questions/comments
- variations in perception of cultural bias could also be sign of prejudice
- self-reported guilt after IAT could aslo be a way to compensate for prejudiced IAT results, hence overestimating the correlation
- jail and prison connection could be explained by this argument, but what about negative words that have no connection with race at all?},

In addition it is argued that variation of turnout will cause substantial variation of political complexion of government. Both hypotheses are falsified in this paper. Rather there are indications that declining electoral turnout is related to weakening socio-political integration of citizens being political uninterested. Only in exceptional cases variation of turnout causes substantial change of political complexion of government.},

The contribution of this article is to propose a new method to estimate the RUM in the presence of strategic voters, without having to construct proxy measures of strategic voting incentives. Our method can be used to infer the counterfactual sincere vote of those who vote strategically and provides an estimate of the size of strategic voting. We illustrate the procedure using post-electoral survey data from Spain. Our calculations indicate that strategic voting in Spain is about 2.19\%.},

This literature got its start arguing that voters' lack of information undermines a defense of democracy rooted in electoral accountability. A more recent literature deepens the debate, with some authors claiming that voters effectively use cues to substitute for information about candidates and policies, and other authors claiming that voters are insufficiently rational to do so. We argue that, regardless of its conclusions about voter competence, this literature's single-minded focus on voter behavior is misguided. We use a sequence of formal models to show that traditional intuitions are incomplete because they ignore the effect that changes in voter behavior have on the equilibrium behavior of politicians. When this strategic interaction is taken into account, increases in voter information or voter rationality sometimes make democratic performance better and sometimes make democratic performance worse. One simply cannot assess the implications of voter characteristics for democratic performance without also studying how those characteristics affect the behavior of politicians.},

The polls use the same sampling frame (registered voters) and the same questions. First, we examine the representativeness of both surveys using information known about the population, and although we find important differences between the two in terms of sampling and nonresponse bias, we also find that both surveys represent the underlying population despite low response rates. We also test for mode effects between surveys due to social desirability and how it influences nondifferentiation or satisficing. Using a variety of methods (t-tests, multivariate regression, and genetic propensity matching), we find evidence that the presence of an interviewer alters response patterns on ego-driven questions. The implications of our work are important, due to the increasing popularity of mixed mode surveys. Researchers need to be methodologically sensitive to these differences when analyzing surveys that allow for different response modes.},

summary:
- Most of the literature on polarization has looked at opinion radicalization rather than opinion alignment. 
- Those scholars who say polarization must imply a divergence of public opinion on a broad set of issues don’t see polarization. Those who say that polarization is when broad partisan or ideological dividing lines exist find polarization (cites on pg 410-411).
- The correlation between issues, PID and ideology has been increasing representing that people are sorting into the parties better based on issue positions. The greatest increase in on moral issues. 
- There is a very slight trend toward more issue alignment, but not substantial enough to be of great significance. 
- For those higher in interest, education there is more evidence for partisan alignment on moral issues and some more evidence for issue alignment on moral issues.},

- paper uses relational class analysis (RCA) to identify distinctive belief networks 
- use RCA as a network-based method to detect heterogeneity in collective patterns of opinion

- 3 groups: ideologues (classic lib/con), alternatives (libertarians), agnostics (weak associations) 
- these groups are stable over time, show expected relationships with sophistication (validity), shows some long-term change (alignment)

- sociodemographics determine in how far individuals belong to one of the groups 
-> cross-pressures lead to alternatives (e.g. rich secular, poor religious)

- relationship between social positions and political beliefs is contingent on the overall organization of beliefs: belief systems as a mediator of sociodemographic attributes and partisanship 
-> same sociodemographic attributes might predict different voting patterns in different ideational groups! -> very relevant for other studies!

=> BUT: in how far does this approach really reveal more than a 2-dimensional conceptualization of ideology and belief systems?

- knowledge questions can be categorized by 2 dimensions: temporal (time when the fact was established) vs. topical (policy-specific or general) -> 4-cell taxonomy of knowledge questions
- classic findings with regard to the predictors of knowledge differ depending on the question type -> effect of education, mass media
- gender gap persists across types of knowledge question
-> "Our analyses reveal that several classic ﬁndings regarding the antecedents of knowledge are conditional upon the type of question being asked." (851)

definition political knowledge:
- "the range of factual information about politics that is stored in long-term memory" (Delli Carpini/Keeter 1996)
- 3 factors: ability, opportunity, and motivation
- temporal dimension (how recently did the fact come into being): static vs. surveillance
- topical dimension (public policy concerns or institutions/players of government): general vs. policy-specific

hypotheses / results:
1) education has a stronger positive effect on general measures of political knowledge than policy-specific knowledge: a) surveillance-general > surveillance-policy, b) static-general > static-policy (confirmed)
2) media coverage has stronger positive effect on surveillance facts than on static facts: a) surveillance-general > static-general, b) surveillance-policy > static-policy (results less clear)
3) the gender gap is smaller for gendered questions compared with non-gendered questions (largely confirmed)},

Pre-election surveys often suffer from an inability to identify and survey the likely electorate for the upcoming election. We propose a new and inexpensive method to conduct representative surveys of the electorate. We demonstrate the performance of our method in producing a representative sample of the future electorate that can be used to study campaign dynamics and many other issues. We compare pre-election outcome forecasts to election outcomes in seven primary and general election surveys conducted prior to the 2008 and 2010 primary and general elections in three states. The results indicate that the methodology produces representative samples, including in low-turnout elections such as primaries where traditional methods have difficulty consistently sampling the electorate. This new methodology combines Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling, mailed invitation letters, and online administration of the questionnaire. The PPS sample is drawn based on a model employing variables from the publicly available voter file to produce a probability of voting score for each individual voter. The proposed method provides researchers a valuable tool to study the attitudes of the voting public.},

- estimates policy positions using twitter follower data
- basic assumption: decision to follow politician/news outlet is based on ideological distance in one-dimensional policy space -> assumes homophily
- validates estimates based on traditional measures of ideology etc.

validations:
1) twitter-based ideal-points replicate existing measures of elite ideology
2) validate mass ideology at aggregate level by comparing groups of twitter users with aggregate self-identified ideology in US states + replicate elite and mass polarization findings
3) validate mass ideology at individual level using campaign contribution records and party registration history

application:
- examine polarization and in political discussion -> echo-chamber rather than pluralist debate

possible extensions:
- estimate positions of "followers of followers"
- dynamic estimation
- bridging between countries},

  comment   = {overview:
- automaticity in attitudes and affective reaction through priming has been shown in previous studies. what about behavioral consequences?
-> authors show that priming can have behavioral consequences, social behavior is activated automatically similar to the automatic activation of social perceptions and attitudes
- trait concepts and stereotypes can activated/primed automatically and result in stereotype-consistent behavior
- as such, automatically activated stereotype-consistent behavior of person A can have a self-fulfilling prophecy effect by triggering behavior that confirms the stereotype (e.g. hostility...)
-> research shows that trait concepts and stereotypes are automatically activated in the presence of relevant behavior

studies/results:
study 1) concept of rudeness was primed in scrambled sentence task (form gramatically correct sentence with 4 out of 5 presented words) -> increased likelihood of interrupting the experimenter / interruption occured earlier
-> study 1 shows that automatic activation of trait concept result in trait-like behavior, study 2 and 3 focus on stereotype activation
study 2) elderly sterotype was primed through scrambled sentence task -> treated participants walked down the hallway more slowly (effect was not due to mood)
study 3) priming through subliminal presentation of faces of African American male faces -> more hostile reaction when responding to experimenter's request to repeat the experiment

Take Home: 
Use this in conjunction with Aarts goal contagion idea and Kay’s material primes, that primes can guide behavior and facilitate socially appropriate behavior given the situation. Also contrast with Strahan who says you need an ‘outlet’ to display primed behavior.

questions/comments:
- what about conscious control? "Control over automatic influences requires three things: (a) awareness of the influence or at least the possibility of the influence, (b) motivation to exert the control, and (c) enough attentional capacity (or lack of distractions) at the time to engage in the control process (see Bargh, 1989; Wegner, 1994)"},

To this end, we executed experiments during the 2000 electoral season that randomly exposed some subjects to an Analytic Hierarchy Processing (AHP) tool, which encourages systematic processing of various orthogonal decision criteria in complex choice environments. We predicted, and found, that the choices of knowledgeable voters exposed to AHP were weaker and less consistent than control group responses, suggesting that systematic processing induces integrative complexity and perhaps "analysis paralysis" among knowledgeable voters. However, we found that among less knowledgeable voters, the opposite pattern generally emerged-AHP exposure was associated with even greater reliance on party ID and ideology cues, perhaps even bolstering predispositions via projection and rationalization.},

  comment   = {- empirical test of Lakoff's parental metaphor 
-> "nation as family" heuristic 
- nuturant vs. disciplinarian visions of proper parenting

main DVs: 
- values, policy preferences, candidate preferences, ideological constraint (coherent preferences + folded preferences)

alternative explanations: 
- Hunter's theory of moral absolutists vs. moral relativists 
- authoritariansims 
- partisan learning 
- several other controls: need for cognition, christianity etc.

results: 
- support the hypotheses, views on parental roles are significant predictors throughout the models

questions: 
- is independence really nurturant? Lakoff might disagree... 
- endogenous variable might be problematic (but they say they used instrumental variables as well) 
- garbage can models?

Summary:
What makes people organize their attitudes consistently as liberal or conservatives? Lakoff argues that it is the power relations between parents and children translate into individuals’ normative beliefs about the role of government (as punisher or helper): “the nation as family”-heuristic. Families either emphasize discipline (strict-father model, people are bad, world is dangerous, prepare children for competitive life for the child’s own good) or nurturance (children obey their parents out of love and not out of threat, social responsibility, acts of charity and love, positive feedback rather than punishment). Compared to constraint by core values, this is a more exogenous explanation – it is logically implausible that the causal arrow runs the other way round. 

Method: 
They test this using ANES data and find support for Lakoff’s theory.},

- “Graded Structure refers to this continuum of category representativeness, beginning with the most typical members of a category and continuing through its atypical members to those nonmembers least similar to category members.” -> Typical Atypical spectrum
- Found by rating how typical an instance is of a category; continuum doesn’t stop at category boundary but keeps going to include all atypical cases
- Two broad types of categories:
 1.Taxonomic: define similar features, correlational structure
 2.Goal-derived/ad-hoc: encounter momentarily but encounter very often. We need to react to something, so create category to respond to object/situation
- Categorization is flexible, constructive process driven by contexts & personal functional goals
- “Recursive/Interactive Process” which can be flexible (though some concepts are perceptual primitives that we could be born with or learn immediately.)
- Determinants of graded structure:
 1.Central tendency: feature similarity, combined exemplars & phototypes
 2.Functional similarity: what concepts get you to the goals
 3.Frequency of instantiation: familiarity over similarity
- “Instead the large number of concepts associated with a category simply reflects a process capable of constructing a wide variety of concepts in working memory from a constantly changing knowledge base in long-term memory. In this sense, people’s conceptual ability is highly productive.” large store of info in LT but not assigned to any category until brought into working memory
- Between & within subject categorization unstable, but most instability in the middle of continuum (most typical & atypical exemplars stable ratings)
- “People are not very good at taking the points of view of their close friends when judging typicality. Nor are people any better at taking the points of view of close friends than they are at taking the points of view of casual acquaintances, at least in the context of judging graded structure.”
 1.Project onto those we like own point of view & those we don’t like opposite point of view (projection important in political world)
 2.Categorize the point of view of other group based on 1) own point of view, 2) stereotypes of groups.
- Take-away: Categorization is goal and context dependent – important for the way people will come to attitudes/evaluations about political stimuli (refer to the McGraw, et al 2002 article for application)},

  abstract  = {The `resource curse' hypothesis claims that abundance in natural resources, particularly oil, encourages especially civil war. Natural resources provide both motive and opportunity for conflict and create indirect institutional and economic causes of instability. Contrarily, the theory of the rentier state - largely neglected in the study of peace and war in this respect - suggests that regimes use revenue from abundant resources to buy off peace through patronage, large-scale distributive policies and effective repression. Consequently, such rentier states would tend to be more stable politically and less prone to conflict. These two theories thus imply ambivalent effects of resource abundance on conflict proneness. This article presents part of a solution to this apparent puzzle for the case of oil-producing countries. The key argument is that both resource wealth per capita and resource dependence need to be taken into account, since only the availability of very high per capita revenues from oil allows governments to achieve internal stability. The empirical analysis supports this hypothesis. The findings of multivariate cross-country regressions indicate a U-shaped relationship between oil dependence and civil war onset, while high resource wealth per capita tends to be associated with less violence. The results of a macro-qualitative comparison for a reduced sample of highly dependent oil exporters are even more clearcut. Using the same reduced sample, we find that oil-wealthy countries apparently manage to maintain political stability by a combination of large-scale distribution, high spending on the security apparatus and protection by outsiders. Compared to oil-poor countries and in contradiction to the rentier state theory, the institutions of oil-wealthy countries do not seem to be particularly characterized by patronage and clientelism.},

Applying a level-k reasoning model approach, strategic behavior is found to be significantly different under each treatment (voting system). Plurality rule leads voters to play in the most sophisticated (i.e. best response), but not necessarily insincere, manner. Thus, this voting system displays at the same time the highest incidence of best responses and of sincere votes. The opposite holds for the Borda count games, where voters depart from their sincere strategy the most, without playing the best response strategy. Approval voting shows intermediate levels of sophistication and sincere behavior.},

  abstract  = {We compare the behavior of voters under simultaneous and sequential voting rules when voting is costly and information is incomplete. In many political institutions, ranging from small committees to mass elections, voting is sequential, which allows some voters to know the choices of earlier voters. For a stylized model, we generate a variety of predictions about the relative efficiency and participation equity of these two systems, which we test using controlled laboratory experiments. Most of the qualitative predictions are supported by the data, but there are significant departures from the predicted equilibrium strategies, in both the sequential and the simultaneous voting games. We find a tradeoff between information aggregation, efficiency, and equity in sequential voting: a sequential voting rule aggregates information better than simultaneous voting and is more efficient in some information environments, but sequential voting is inequitable because early voters bear more participation costs},

Our experiment controls for different information levels of voters, as well as the size of the electorate, the distribution of preferences and other theoretically relevant parameters. The design varies the share of partisan voters and the prior belief about a payoff relevant state of the world. Our results support the equilibrium predictions of the Feddersen-Pesendorfer model. The voters act as if they are aware of the swing voter's curse and adjust their behaviour to compensate. While the compensation is not complete and there is some heterogeneity in individual behaviour, we find that aggregate outcomes, such as efficiency, turnout and margin of victory, closely track the theoretical predictions.},

Is the impact of unemployment on political marginalisation related to the development of the welfare state? Based on Marshall's concept of social citizenry, and Esping-Andersen's theory of decommodification politics, the impact of unemployment on political marginalisation was expected to be least in the most-developed welfare states. In these countries, welfare policies were expected to counteract marginalisation among the unemployed. The analyses were based on the Eurobarometer survey Young Europeans from 1990. Three aspects of political marginalisation were investigated: political confidence, political interest and political extremism. Unemployed youth express less confidence in politics, they talk less about politics and they more frequently support revolutionary political ideas, compared with employed youth. The greatest difference in political confidence between unemployed and employed is found in Great Britain, while Italy represents a deviant case where the unemployed have more confidence than the employed. The development of the welfare state does not appear to be a crucial factor for political confidence among the unemployed.},

This article focuses on the decline of trust in Canada during the period 1984 to 1993, and on its effect on Canadian voting behaviour. We build upon M.J. Hetherington's ('The effect of political trust on the presidential vote, 1968-1996', American Political Science Review 93 (1999): 311-326) work to explore the impact of political trust on the vote and on abstention in a multiparty electoral context. Multinomial logit estimations are performed using individual-level survey data from three Canadian federal elections. While distrust is shown to significantly affect electoral participation, thus acting as an alienating factor, the results indicate that decreasing trust acts more as a motivation to support third-party alternatives. The study further demonstrates that, in a multiple party setting, `old-line' major parties electorally suffer from declining political trust, but some third parties benefit more from this phenomenon than others. Contrary to what was the case in the previous two elections, distrustful individuals in 1993 were more likely to vote for the Reform Party or the Bloc Quebecois than support the New Democratic Party.},

voting changes by social units:
- individual vote change is proportional to amount of discussion with opposing views
- social groups: family members, friends, co-workers
- social strata: religion, union membership
- majority position is more stable within strata with unambiguous political preferences
- changes in aggregat vote represent shifts in balance of opposed groups
- individuals under cross-pressures (from different groups) are more likely to change their vote choice and take their decision later in the campaign 

voting changes by time units:
- voting change between generations is affected by political traditions of social strata -> stronger deviation from parents in direction of consistency with social group
- voters are more alike in the present than the past family
- group tradition in voting survives more easily than father-to-son identities of preferences
- low discussion -> low stability, more susceptible to overall trend in public opinion
- deviations from social groups stronger between campaigns than within campaigns
-> campaign increases homogeneity within and polarization between religious and occupational groups -> pulsation movement in polarization over time


CHAPTER 14 (Introduction):
- discusses normative questions related to their study on voting behavior and public opinion

individuals do not meet certain requirements of democratic theory:
- interest, discussion, motivation is low
- knowledge, level of information is low, perceptions of issues are biased
- vote habitually/impulsively instead of on the basis of principle -> vote according to group attachment, network cues
- vote choice appears not to be rational -> sentiment and disposition rather than reasoned preferences
-> BUT: even though individual voters do not satisfy requirements, the system works well...

requirements for the democratic system to work properly:
- involvement and indifference: not everyone needs to be interested, low interest allows for more change
- stability and flexibility
- progress and conservation
- consensus and cleavage
- individualism and collectivism: group decisions and information etc.
-> need for heterogeneity in the population, distribution of individual qualities along important dimensions},

Study 1 (precinct-level data, polling location data, zip-code information, age/condition of school data):
- Analyzing precinct-level vote outcomes and polling location data from the Arizona 2000 general election the authors find that people who voted in schools were by two percentage points (56.02% vs. 53.99%) more likely to support a proposition for raising the state sales tax in order to fund education than people who cast their vote in other locations. 
- This difference persisted even when controlling for: 
 - systematic regional differences in political preferences: (i) no other proposition showed a difference between school location vs. other location, thus, school locations are not more often present in liberal areas (ii) no difference between voters who voted in school locations and voters who live equally far from schools but voted in non-school locations (no difference between school locations and non-school locations that were close to schools), hence, school locations have a similar catchment area as non-school locations. 
 - turnout: similar turnout at school and non-school locations 
 - age and condition of schools: no difference between run-down and well maintained school locations 

Study 2 (Lab Experiment):
- Part 1: two weeks before the actual experiment (part 2), individuals completed an attitude survey on attitudes towards taxes and school funding. 
- Part 2: instead of actually voting in a school, individuals were (under a cover story) first primed with pictures of schools (priming condition) or other generic buildings (neutral condition) and had then to vote on the Arizona education initiative. 
- Outcome: individuals voted more frequently in favor of school funding in the priming condition than in the neutral condition. Similarly, people voted more frequently in favor of school funding when they had previously indicated a pro-school funding attitude, a pro-tax attitude or where a parent. The authors find, however, no interaction effect between attitude x priming condition, suggesting that the priming did not affect the vote choice via activating a latent pro-school funding attitude but via priming in general.

Why should we care? 
(i) Two percent can make the difference; it takes a lot of campaign money to shift the popular vote share by two percent. 
(ii) Pretty smart study design},

- aggregate public opinion measuered in polls may be a poor reflection of collective public sentiment -> argues against Verba/Schlozman/Brady
- selection bias: individuals might answer "don't know" to avoid socially sensitive issues
- empirical evidence: NES overstates support for school integration, selection models predict results of racially charged 1989 New York mayor election better than polls
-> survey questions on socially sensitive issues (like racial attitudes) may provide inaccurate picture of public sentiment
-> aggregate public opinion is not an unbiased form of mass participation

theoretical argument
- survey interview as social interaction
- opinion constructed by individual (c.f. Zaller/Feldman) not necessarily the same as the opinion expressed by the respondent
- hard and easy issues in terms of social and cultural constraints
-> social desireability
-> report "don't know" in order not to reveal true attitude

study:
- school integration question in NES
- branched questions: 1) do you have an opinion and 2) if yes, what is your opinion?
- check whether decision to respond DK is independent of opinion
- bivariate probit selection model
- correlation of errors b/w selection equation and outcome equation -> do unmeasured factors in both models correlate?
- predict NYC mayoral race with selection model

question:
- what about the selection process leading individuals to report the socially acceptable answer instead of DK?
- why focus on unmeasured aspects? shouldn't the measured factors matter as well?
- could better prediction of mayoral race be also explained by difference in turnout?

IDEA:
- difference b/w online survey and f2f survey -> e.g. using the recent ANES!!!},

- MTurk samples replicate important experimental findings: responses to stimuli consistent with prior research, habitual response does not appear to be a problem
- MTurk subjects pay more attention to task than other other respondents

This study examines the online foreign news usage of a representative sample of Internet users during the conflict with Iraq. The results indicate that approximately one-fourth of Internet news consumers use foreign sites. Also, by considering the differences in perspective between mainstream domestic news and foreign news and using the notion of selective exposure, the authors generate hypotheses regarding foreign online news usage. After controlling for other theoretically relevant factors, they find that those most opposed to the Bush administration possess the greatest likelihood of supplementing their domestic online news with an online foreign source.},

  number    = {2},
  pages     = {242--253},
  volume    = {27},
  comment   = {overview:
- Formations of attitudes are stored in a “value account” which is essentially a structure holding summary evaluations of stimuli.
- This summary value account is more accessible in memory than are specific examples about stimuli. Attitude judgments should be based on ‘value accounts’ especially under cognitive constraint.
- Results: Total implicit process of stock shares did just as good as explicit exposure. People learned the same thing implicitly, so couldn’t say why they knew info/evaluation.
- When given unlimited time to respond, participants tended to use more memory-based, rather than summative, judgments.
- Implicit attitudes are summative and can guide “correct” judgments.

Purpose of Experiment:
- To understand how the encoding of value-charged stimuli (stimuli that elicit positive or negative reactions) effect implicit online formation of attitudes
- Specifically, to examine if and how value-charged stimuli contribute to attitude formation in the absence of conscious evaluation

Hypotheses/Assumptions of the Value-Account Approach:
1.Encoding of value-charged stimuli is sufficient to initiate implicit online formations of attitudes
2.The process is summative: formations of attitudes are stored in a unitary memory structure, which they term a “value account” 
 a.The value account provides a summary evaluation that serves as the basis of future attitude judgments about a target
 b.Contradicts “averaging” models of attitude formation (Anderson 1971, 1981)
3.This summary “value account” is more accessible in memory than are specific examples about stimuli
 a.Attitude judgments will be based on “value accounts,” especially when cognitive capacities are const rained (time pressure, etc.)

Experiment and Results:
- Because memory is capable of automatically recording frequency of events, and is especially sensitive to the frequency of value-charged experience, Betsch et al. assumes that we are cognitively hardwired to implicitly perform accumulative operations online 
 -> Hypothesizes that we are not only sensitive to frequency of events, but intensities of values, and that frequency values are integrated in a summative fashion (contradicts averaging as a central mechanism in attitude formation)
- All experiments simultaneously exposed participants to an add they were to attend to in the center of the screen (told this was their main focus) and fake stock ticket at the bottom they were to simultaneously read aloud 
 -> Shares were used as attitude objects (represent profit on the outcome dimension) 
 -> The stimulus material consisted of five shares that differed with respect to their sum of return values
 -> Return values represented increases or decreases in a share value over a prior trading date, and not absolute price of the share 

Experiment 1:
Participants were asked to focus their attention on ads appearing in the middle of the screen while simultaneously reading share information appearing in a running caption aloud; after answering questions about the ads, meant to reinforce the researchers’ cover story as well as extinguish concrete memories about single returns, they were then asked to assess their attitudes towards the five shares, estimate the sum of each share, and the share’s average return
- Results: Participants were not able to accurately estimate the sums or average returns of any of the stocks, but attitudes perfectly corresponded with the sum of returns of the share: the share with the largest sum of returns received the most positive attitude judgment by participants and the share with the smallest sum received the least positive attitude judgment by participants.
- Issues: Experiment 1 could not rule out the “peak-and-end rule” whereby people are assumed to base their evaluative judgments of past episodes on a limited number of outstanding events, such as the peak and end; utilizing such a heuristic is considered a special versions of the averaging rule where peak and end experiences are weighted positively, and other experiences are assigned a zero weight….So, on to Experiment 2.

Experiment 2:
Subjects were exposed to return distributions of six shares—each of which dominated the other in one feature (SUM, FREQUENCY, AVERAGE, PEAK, EXPOSE, EXPOSE*). Introduced two between-subject factors: mode of attitude measure was manipulated (comparative vs. absolute) and the focus of attention was manipulated (ads vs. shares).
- Results: As hypothesized, the sum of values was the dominant factor in the implicit attitude formation: the share with the largest sum receiving the most positive attitude judgment by participants and the share with the smallest sum receiving the least positive attitude judgment. This finding was robust against modes of attitude measure (comparative vs. absolute) and attentional focus (ads vs. shares).

Experiment 3:
Participants were exposed to sums and returns of six shares (2 target and 4 distractors). Participants were asked to remember the return values highlighted in red. The share highlighted in red was manipulated (high sum/low return vs. low sum/high return) and the time pressure for responding was manipulated (6 seconds vs. unlimited time). 
- Hypothesis: in the absence of time pressure, attitude judgments should reflect the values of returns that were made salient during encoding; under time constraint, attitude judgments should rely on value accounts
- Results: Under time constraints, attitude judgments corresponded to the differences in the sum of returns (accurate judgment); whereas, in the absence of time constraints, judgments were based on the difference in the shares’ return exemplars (difference between highest return reported for each share, but not the share with the best payoff). When given unlimited time to respond, participants tended to use more memory-based, rather than summative, judgments.

Relation to this Week’s Readings:
- Like the implicit on-line assessment attitude formation model put forth by Lodge et al. (1995), Betsch et al. demonstrate that implicit attitudes are summative, and can lead to the “right” choice even when explicit memories said choice are based on have been forgotten.
- Like Wilson et al. (1991), finds that introspection about one’s decisions (longer time evaluation of explicit considerations) may cause someone to second-guess their implicit attitudes and make suboptimal decisions.},

Using an agent-based computational model, we analyze the polarization-conflict relationship when ethnic salience is ``fixed{''}-high for every member of two nominally rival ethnic groups and ``variable{''}-permitted to vary across individuals as a function of relative income. We find that (1) when salience is fixed, conflict onset is twice as high at low levels of polarization compared to when salience is permitted to vary, with the difference decreasing at high levels of polarization; (2) the relationship between conflict onset and the range over which we calculate variable salience is positive and robust for low and moderate levels of polarization; (3) the relationship between polarization and conflict onset is robust even under minority domination, if one holds salience fixed; and (4) holding ethnic salience fixed effectively amplifies the negative effect of polarization on economic performance.},

  comment   = {overview:
- traditional (single-shot) causal inference methods are insufficient to capture dynamic processes because they essentially assume that decisions are made all at once, which "forces a choice between omitted variable bias and posttreatment bias"
- issue of time-varying confounders that affect future treatment, is affected by past treatment, and is correlated with the outcome -> controlling for it leads to posttreatment bias and not controlling for it leads to omitted variable bias
- dynamic causal inference captures the effect of a whole action history (i.e., history of past treatment values) rather than the effect of an individual treatment at time t
- basic method relies on inverse probability of treatment weigting (IPTW) combined with marginal structural models (MSM), the weighting creates a pseudosample where dynamic selection is eliminated and the MSM "dictates the form of the relationship between the large number of possible action histories and the outcome and serve to reduce the number of causal parameters"
- method requires strong assumptions (sequential ignorability & positivity/common support) and develops a diagnostic tool (history-adjusted balance) as well as a sensitivity-analysis framework to address potential causes of concern

questions/comments
- method is very interesting but there are a couple of reasons why it probably cannot directly be used for the CCRB project with Ben. The first reason is that treatements are assumed to be binary (although an extension to continuous treatments may be possible). More importantly, the method assumes that there is a single outcome at the end of the time period and we are estimating the effect of different action/treatment histories. In our case, however, we have outcome measures at each time point, which makes the whole weighting strategy more complicated (and I am not quite sure if it is actually feasible).},

In particular, researchers are often worried about the assumption of no omitted variables or no unmeasured confounders. This article combines two approaches to sensitivity analysis to provide researchers with a tool to investigate how specific violations of no omitted variables alter their estimates. This approach can help researchers determine which narratives imply weaker results and which actually strengthen their claims. This gives researchers and critics a reasoned and quantitative approach to assessing the plausibility of causal effects. To demonstrate the approach, I present applications to three causal inference estimation strategies: regression, matching, and weighting.},

  abstract  = {<p>Social scientists typically devote considerable effort to reducing measurement error during data collection and then ignore the issue during data analysis. Although many statistical methods have been proposed for reducing measurement error-induced biases, few have been widely used because of implausible assumptions, high levels of model dependence, difficult computation, or inapplicability with multiple mismeasured variables. We develop an easy-to-use alternative that generalizes the popular multiple imputation (MI) framework by treating missing data problems as a special case of extreme measurement error and correcting for both. Like MI, the proposed "multiple overimputation" (MO) framework is a simple two-step procedure. First, multiple (ca. 5) completed copies of the data set are created where cells measured without error are held constant, those missing are imputed from the distribution of predicted values, and cells (or entire variables) with measurement error are "overimputed," that is imputed from a predictive distribution with observation-level priors defined by the mismeasured values and available external information, if any. In the second step, analysts can then run whatever statistical method they would have run on each of the overimputed data sets as if there had been no missingness or measurement error; the results are then combined via a simple procedure. We also (will) offer open source software that implements all the methods described herein.</p>},

Our findings suggest that in absence of electoral history, voters cannot coordinate their efforts successfully and are more likely to vote sincerely. However, as history becomes available, the vote threshold induces strategic coordination on parties that performed best in previous elections.},

Students in two universities were exposed to a ten-minute presentation about the rational model of voting and the ï¿½paradoxï¿½ that so many people vote when it is apparently irrational on a cost-benefit basis. Our data indicate that exposure to the presentation decreased turnout in the election by seven percentage points. This result contributes to the debate abut the effect of rational-choice models on real political behavior. More important, the experimental panel data permit the presentation's effect to be decomposed, and this helps explain why people do vote. In this study, turnout was reduced mainly because the presentation diminished the respondents' sense of duty, an effect that was indirect, because there was no reference in the presentation to such motives. Framing the voting act in rational-choice terms induced some students to reconsider whether they should feel obliged to vote.},

  abstract  = {Most nations have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960. Yet while civil war is central to many nations' development, it has stood at the periphery of economics research and teaching. The past decade has witnessed a long overdue explosion of research into war's causes and consequences. We summarize progress, identify weaknesses, and chart a path forward. Why war? Existing theory is provocative but incomplete, omitting advances in behavioral economics and making little progress in key areas, like why armed groups form and cohere, or how more than two armed sides compete. Empirical work finds that low per capita incomes and slow economic growth are both robustly linked to civil war. Yet there is little consensus on the most effective policies to avert conflicts or promote postwar recovery. Cross-country analysis of war will benefit from more attention to causal identification and stronger links to theory. We argue that micro-level analysis and case studies are also crucial to decipher war's causes, conduct, and consequences. We bring a growth theoretic approach to the study of conflict consequences to highlight areas for research, most of all the study of war's impact on institutions. We conclude with a plea for new and better data. (JEL D72, D74, O17)},

  abstract  = {It is very common to analyse the factors associated with the onset and continuation of civil wars entirely separately, as if there were likely to be no similarity between them. This is an overstatement of the theoretical position, which has established only that they may be different (i.e. less than perfectly correlated). The hypothesis that the explanatory variables are the same is not theoretically excludable and is empirically testable, both for individual variables and for combinations of them. Starting from this approach yields a rather different picture of the factors associated with the continuation of civil wars, because the relatively small sample size means that confidence intervals on individual coefficients are wide in this case. It is shown here that country size, mountainous terrain and (in most datasets) ethnic diversity seem significant for the continuation of civil wars, starting from the null hypothesis that variables affect onset and continuation probabilities identically, rather than entirely independently. One variable that affects onset and continuation significantly differently is anocracy, which we find to matter only for onset. Civil war is more likely if it occurred two years previously, as well as one year previously, which indicates that wars are more likely to restart after only one year of peace, and also more likely to stop in their first year. The combined model strengthens the result that ethnic diversity matters (it is consistently significant across datasets, whereas it is not when onset is analysed separately), although in the UCD/PRIO dataset it is significant only for onset. By contrast, if continuation is analysed independently, virtually nothing is significant except a pre-1991 dummy and a dummy for civil war two years previously.},

  abstract  = {Local community involvement has long been regarded as central to citizens' participation in the political process because it is believed to create attitudes of generalized trust that encourage citizens to become involved in governance. Recently Putnam (1995a) has argued that declining opportunities for community involvement have led to decreased trust in others, and this contributes to declining rates of voting in elections. This paper directly tests the validity of Putnam's argument. It shows that civic participation is related to political participation, but only through the mediating, mechanism of generalized trust. The paper further examines why citizens participate in their communities. It finds that people participate more in their communities when they feel that they are respected members of those communities. Implications for psychological theory and political mobilization are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Decision makers must often make judgments in an environment in which they have a strong motivation to reach a particular conclusion. While normative theory would indicate that they should use available information to make their most accurate judgment without being influenced by the conclusion or outcome it may imply, evidence from the social judgment literature suggests that motivation does bias the judgment process. Specifically, decision makers motivated to support a particular conclusion tend to adopt information processing strategies most likely to yield the desired conclusion. We propose and empirically demonstrate two extensions to the motivation literature. First, we argue that motivated reasoning isinstrumental,meaning motivated decision makers bias their judgments more or less as needed to support the desired conclusion, subject to ï¿½reasonablenessï¿½ constraints. Second, we propose that motivated decision makers exhibitconfidence bolsteringand thereby remain at least as confident as non-motivated decision makers in their biased estimates. We illustrate that motivated subjects even report confidence in utilizing these estimates outside the original motivating context. We investigate motivational effects within a business context involving forecasting, strategic decision making, and new product introductions. We explore the impact of motivation on quantitative forecasts and estimates, rather than on social judgments and perceptions. In addition, we go a step beyond the judgment phase to demonstrate that motivation influences choice.},

I analyze experimentally the conditions under which one cue (the statements of an endorser) enables both sophisticated and unsophisticated citizens to improve their decisions. My results demonstrate that the effectiveness of this cue depends upon the endorser's incentives and citizens' levels of sophistication. Specifically, I find that under idealized conditions (i.e., when the endorser always has an incentive to make truthful statements), this cue dramatically improves the decisions of (and closes the gap between) sophisticated and unsophisticated subjects. When the endorser's incentives are more realistic (i.e., the endorser may have an incentive to lie), this cue affects sophisticated versus unsophisticated subjects differently: sophisticated subjects do not improve their decisions, whereas unsophisticated subjects typically improve their decisions enough to make them comparable to sophisticated subjects. Thus, even under more realistic conditions, the gap between sophisticated and unsophisticated subjects closes.},

- investigate nature and causes of gender gap in partisanship: 1977 - 2000 
- look at difference in party ID between men and women 
- women and men are expected to react differently to the political/social/economic environment, which widens or narrows the gap
- e.g. women should react negatively to a change toward conservatism in the political environment because it is more negative toward welfare and either women are more compassionate than men or will be more hurt by the cuts in welfare. 

hypothesis: 
1) degree of conservatism increases gap 
2) poor economic conditions widen the gap 
3) social structure (increasing percentage of well educated women + number of single women) decreases gap -> but: reverse effect is also plausible

results: 
- gender differences in partisanship are fractionally integrated 
- influence of impulse diminishes but lasts for a long period 
- hypotheses are supported: conservative macroideology, infation, single women increases the gender gap
=> "economic vulnerability may best explain the effects of social changes on gender differences"

questions/comments:
- very interesting paper, very good arguments why it makes sense to look at the difference in partisanship rather than for men and women separately 
-> BUT: if you look at the difference, you cannot say whether changes in the gap are due to moves among women and men
-> POTENTIAL PAPER FOR AMERICAN POLITICS USING ARFIMA-MLM

ideas:
- interaction between women education and singel women 
- model changing correlation over time! 
- methodological questions: why did they include separated gender partisanship instead of difference as a control? why didn't they include a main effect of presidential party? -> because it's a -1/1 dummy -> but this assumes that the effect is the same in both directions!},

  comment   = {basic idea: 
- link individual and aggregate level partisanship 
- main argument: depending on how partisanship develops on the individual level, different aggregate patterns should evolve 
- main finding: aggregate partisanship is fractionally integrated 
-> individual level: partisanship has to be less than persistent (0<a<1) and other factors are only fractionally integrated

Contributions: 
Some theories of partisanship (green and palmquist, Campbell) argue that partisanship is a lasting and enduring political attitude. Revisionists argue that it is more short term and can be caused by political factors. If revisionists are correct when we aggregate, we would expect to see a time series with a unit root (ie shocks are permanent). If traditionalists are correct: time series will be stationary and shock will quickly return to it's mean level. Could be heterogenous population though. Find that series are fractionally integrated. This argues against Stimson like arguments. Shocks can change partisanship for a good number of years. However they are not permanent, nor completely transitory.

Question/comments: 
- the result rests on the main assumption that all other factors are in fact level-factors 
- if this assumption is dropped, the deduction for the theoretical model based on the empirical pattern seems less clear... (?)
- starting point for unit root tests --> critical values!},

  abstract  = {Politicians routinely appeal to the emotions of voters, a practice critics claim subverts the rational decision making on which democratic processes properly rest. But we know little about how emotional appeals actually influence voting behavior. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that political ads can change the way citizens get involved and make choices simply by using images and music to evoke emotions. Prior research suggests voters behave differently in different emotional states but has not established whether politicians can use campaigns to manipulate emotions and thereby cause changes in political behavior. This article uses two experiments conducted during an actual election to show that: (1) cueing enthusiasm motivates participation and activates existing loyalties; and (2) cueing fear stimulates vigilance, increases reliance on contemporary evaluations, and facilitates persuasion. These results suggest campaigns achieve their goals in part by appealing to emotions, and emotional appeals can promote democratically desirable behavior.},
  comment   = {overview:
- emotions in campaign ads can change the way citizens get involved in politics and make choices
- enthusiasm -> participation, existing loyalties
- fear -> vigilance, reliance on contemporary evaluations, persuasion
-> Prior research (e.g. affective intelligence) shows that voters behave differently depending on emotional state. Brader examines whether politicians can manipulate emotions through ads to affect behavior. He hypothesizes different types of effects for enthusiasm and fear appeals.
-> enthusiasm increase participation and partisan loyalty. Fear stimulates vigilance and persuasion. Fear = systematic information seeking, enthusiasm = heuristic thinking

Method:
Experiment. Subjects viewed a 30-minute news broadcast, during which treatment ads were shown. The ads were tied to an actual gubernatorial primary. A neutral ad is compared to ads with either reassuring or threatening cues. The emotional content of the ads is manipulated through imagery and music.

Findings:
Cueing enthusiasm motivates participation and activates existing loyalties, whereas cueing fear stimulates vigilance and facilitates persuasion. Fear stimulates information seeking and enthusiasm causes one to think heuristically. Implications from this study question the idea that negative ads necessarily demobilize the electorate.},

The resources considered are time, money, and civic skills-those communications and organizational capacities that are essential to political activity. These skills are not only acquired early in life but developed in the nonpolitical institutional settings of adult life: the workplace, organizations, and churches and synagogues. These resources are distributed differentially among groups defined by socioeconomic status. A two-stage least squares analysis shows these resources have powerful effects on overall political activity, thus explaining why socioeconomic status has traditionally been so powerful in predicting participation. We disaggregate overall activity into three kinds of acts: those that involve giving time, those that entail donating money, and voting. Each requires a different configuration of resources resulting in different patterns of stratification across various political acts.},

Unlike other methods, the method described in this article provides a statistical framework for testing a wide range of hypotheses about these models including their functional form, their dimensionality, and the values of specific parameters. The Hinich ideal-point model is estimated using this method. It fits the data remarkably well compared to a standard factor analysis model that does not provide a reasonable fit to the data. This has the substantive implication of suggesting that voters base their voting decisions upon ideal-point dimensions like liberalism-conservatism and not upon factor analysis dimensions like competence and leadership.},

Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10\% of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

frustration-aggression theory (partly copied from summary):
- group hostility explained by displaced aggression caused by frustration/individual anger arousal
- frustration does not have to be rooted in group-dynamics but can be completely independent
- extension incorporates cognitive factors to predict which scapegoat is choosen -> environmental cues etc.
- theory cannot explain uniform and goal-oriented nature of much intergroup aggression

relative deprivation theory:
- attainments vs. expectation -> discontent driven by (perceived) negative discrepancy b/w current standard of living and what they deserve
- expectations can be driven by past experience or comparison with others
- egoistic deprivation vs. collective deprivation -> role of group identification!
- how is comparison group chosen? similarity?

realistic group interest theory:
- conflictual goals as major determinant of intergroup competition and antagonism
- common/superordinate goals can lead to cooperation, less animosity -> cooperation has to be successful!
- social identity affects psychological impact of conflict of interests

1) authoritarian personality + right-wing authoritarianism (RWA)
- problems with F-scale -> acquiescence, sample, left authoritarianism, confounding with conservatism etc.
- RWA (submission, agression, conventionalism) -> problem of several dimensions, only concentrates on the right

- empirical evidence unclear
3) social dominance theory

- criticism: SDO as social attitude rather than personality / fixed predisposition
- author argues that causal status is not clear, some empirical evidence problematic

problems with personality approaches

Instead, it appears that conflict increases dependence on resource extraction (as a default sector). Moreover, resource abundance is associated with a reduced probability of the onset of war.

It has been speculated that the public may be unfit for self-governance due to lack of policy knowledge, as well as a willingness to blindly conform to the wishes of superiors. Moreover, even when voters are informed, they may react to information based on its partisan implications rather than reasoning based on its substantive content. This paper examines whether party cues override the influence of information when it is present. It also looks at how party cues affect depth of processing.

Method
Two experiments. 
Study 1: Within a mock newspaper article on a Medicaid reform proposal, both party cue (Dems support, Dems oppose, or no cue) and policy information (reduce vs expand Medicaid benefits) are manipulated. 
Study 2: Additional manipulation of size of policy change (either large or small changes to status quo). Additional depth of processing measure (time spent reading article). Includes open-ended thoughts on the article, which were coded for valence.

Findings
Study 1: The party cue affected support for the reform proposal in an intuitive manner (e.g. Dems were more likely to support a Dem-endorsed policy), but the size of the effect was small. Substantive information about the policies had a much larger influence on attitudes (e.g. Dems were more likely to support the expansionist policy). Need for cognition moderates the effect of information differently depending on partisanship, making Dems more responsive to policy content and Reps less responsive (which is unexpected). The presence of party cues did not reduce depth of processing (as indicated by recall of policy details).
Study 2: Dems were more responsive to policy information than cues, while Reps were more responsive to party cues than information. Larger expected changes from the status quo increased the role of policy information to a small degree. The moderating role of need for cognition remains the same. Depth of processing is again unaffected by the presence of party cues.
Bullock’s conclusions are generally optimistic. When exposed to policy information, voters can arrive at attitudes independent of elite influence.},

- inference about mediators in experimental context is difficult
- baron-kenny method yields biased estimates

threats to mediation analysis: (copy)
1) must only affect mediator in question and no other mediators
2) applies to "only and unknown set of subjects"
3) inaccurate with heterogeneity in effects of X and M

recommendations:
1) describe why unobserved factors that affect M are uncorrelated with Y as well as other unobserved mediators
2) explain why manioulation exclusively affects mediator under consideration
3) conduct studies that examine differently induced changes in M (?)
4) average direct and indirect effects are problematic due to heterogeneity, identify relatively homogenous subgroups and make inference about indirect effect within each subgroup rather than single average indirect effect
5) usage of repeated measures experimental design (with repeated interventions) could help solve problem with heterogeneous treatment effects},

  abstract  = {The antecedents of political disaffection and political activism have been extensively studied in adult populations, producing two models of political protest, the `dissatisfaction model', suggesting that protest action is rooted in political disaffection, and the `resource model' which bases interest in politics in a sense of political self-efficacy. There has been a dearth of research extending this theorizing to young people of prevoting age. The present study presents the results of regression analysis applied to longitudinal data collected in a U. K. programme of research and economic and political socialization, the ESRC 16-19 Initiative. The analysis relates `lack of interest in politics', `intention not to vote' and `political activity, to attitudes, personality characteristics, experience and circumstances measured earlier. It is concluded that political disaffection, including lack of interest and intention not to vote, is strongly associated with a growing cynicism about politics rooted in poor educational performance and a working class family background The connections with activism are negative but much weaker, suggesting the potential for protest activity across a wider spectrum of youth. This lends support to Marsh's (1990) view that given the right circumstances, protest action under both the `resource model', and the `dissatisfaction model', can apply.},

- RQ: Is the president able to affect legislative outcomes (on budget decisions) through public appeals? 
- data: legislative outcomes on federal budget votes from 1958-1997 
- method: simulataneous equations, instrumental variables -> presidential proposals and legislative outcomes for agency budgets (DV), is an issue promoted in a presidential address (IV)

hypotheses:
(1) A president should gain influence on policy issues he chooses to promote in public appeals
(2) president's likelihood of appealing to the public should be positively correlated with the popularity of his policy proposal
(3) president's likelihood of appealing to the public over an issue should be negatively correlated with his expected influence absent this action 

findings:
- hypotheses supported, president has influence, but it is moderated by popularity of proposal and the influence of the appeal -> presidents are strategic in their appeals
- president gains legislative influence on policies he promotes, the likelihood of appealing is positively correlated with policy popularity (more likely to publically appeal if public is supportive), and presidential plebiscitary activity focuses on policies that would not achieve success if not promoted (Congress unlikely to act on their own to enact the policy)
-> Presidents have little to no effect on issues that are salient prior to appeals
-> Presidents don't actually change public opinion, but make an issue more salient -> Congress more likely to follow public opinion on salient issues.},

critical moment:
- March/April 1964, Lyndon Johnson's speech

realignment steps: 
- Elites debate a new issue, parties stake a position.
- Public decides whether it gives a crap (they ignore it if its unimportant)
- If public decides its important they note party positions.
- Change party if the issue is important. Change stance to align with party if it isn't.
- Realignments happen when the public is pretty split on the issue and it doesn't align with preexisting cleavages.
- Elites determine what positions party take, while public can determine salience.
- Uses South and civil rights as example.},

- theories are merged in framework that views ideology as motivated social cognition + Big 5 framework (Openness to Experience, Conscientousness + Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
- aspects of ideology: acceptance vs. rejection of inequality + preference for social change vs. status quo -> manage epistemic and existential needs to manage uncertainty and threat 
- "political conservatism is an ideological belief system that consists of two core components, resistance to change and opposition to equality, which serve to reduce uncertainty and threat"
- provides converging evidence that lliberals and conservatives differ in openness and conscientousness in the context of surveys, behavior, and living styles
- liberals: open-minded, creative, curious, novelty-seeking
- conservatives: orderly, conventional, organized
- but there are also similarities, e.g. regarding the remaining B5 dimensions

study 1: Personality Differences between Liberals and Conservatives
- general personalit profiles of liberals and conservatives measured through 
- multiple samples, Big 5 items + conservatism
- result: openness - conscientousness

study 2: Nonverbal Behavior and Interpersonal Styles of Liberals and Conservatives
- goes beyond self-reported measure of personality and directly examines behavior in social interactions -> how do personality differences play out in the context of everyday lives
- participants discussed movies with confederates, coders observed non-verbal behavior and compared liberals and conservatives
- openness: body orientation. expressivity, speech errors, smiles, less halting speech
- conscientousness: eye-gaze and perceived responsiveness, fewer hand movements and gestures, detached, self-touching, hostility
- Liberals were more expressive, smiled more, and were more engaged in the discussion
- Liberals did not show more behavior indicative of conscientousness.

study 3: Room Cues and the Things They Leave Behind
- comparison of rooms and office spaces
- liberals: different style, colors, distinctiveness, greater number and diversity of books, travel documents, art supplies etc.
- conservatives: neat, organized, conventional forms of decoration, greater number of items such as calendars and cleaning supplies
- consistent patterns regarding differences on openness as well as conscientousness

question for the class:
- why does so much research focus on theories of conservatism rather than theories of ideology in general?
- how do the results relate to morality? E.g. purity dimension},

- experiment 3 controls for need for cognition and need for closure but not for more relevant factors (fear of threat etc.)

Find that challenger quality has large impact on vote share. Also war casualties had a role. 
However challenger quality is endogenous (aka more quality challengers when incumbents are weak) which is not accounted for in model. 

Analyzed the 1862-1863 election during the Civil War – in 1862 big backlash against Lincoln and Republicans – Challenger quality matters and so do district level effects like district-level casualties – The national tide also matters – in 1862 big drop for being a republican, but in 1863, the backlash had subsided and not a big drop anymore.

Summary:
The elections of 1862-63 were disastrous to Republicans because of both national and district-specific effects. National level effects (e.g., Lincoln’s Emancipation proclamation, Union’s defeats, etc.) had varying degrees of influence because elections were held at different times. Particularly, many of the elections held in 1862 were not favorable for Republicans due to national events. District-specific effects include incumbency fatigue and quality challengers. Because the Republican party was doing so poorly, more quality challengers emerged, thus resulting in Republican loss. Take home message: Timing and national/district-specific events can affect elections.},

Across subjects we vary the probability that their vote will decide which disbursement is made. As the probability of being decisive is lowered, the opportunity cost of giving expression to charitable sentiment decreases; hence, the likelihood of voting in accordance with such sentiment is expected to increase. We find weak support for the hypothesis, but the results do not replicate when we alter the parameter settings. Limitations of our design are discussed.},

When the order of the agenda is exogenous, a sufficient condition guarantees the existence of welfare gains, relative to simple majority voting. But is efficiency compromised if a chair controls the order of the agenda? The agenda becomes cheap talk and can be used to transmit information about the chair's priorities. The game has multiple equilibria, differing in the precision of the information transmitted, but the welfare impact is minor, and the comparison to simple majority voting is unchanged. In laboratory experiments, subjects have difficulty identifying the informative strategies, but payoffs are effectively identical to theoretical predictions. The bonus vote matters; the chair's control of the agenda does not.

Each member is allocated a fixed budget of votes to be cast as desired over the sequence of decisions. This provides incentives for voters to spend more votes on those decisions that matter to them more, typically generating welfare gains over standard majority voting with non-storable votes. Equilibrium strategies have a very intuitive feature-the number of votes cast must be monotonic in the voter's intensity of preferences-but are otherwise difficult to calculate, raising questions of practical implementation. We present experimental data where realized efficiency levels were remarkably close to theoretical equilibrium predictions, while subjects adopted monotonic but off-equilibrium strategies. We are led to conclude that concerns about the complexity of the game may have limited practical relevance.},

  abstract  = {The hypothesis that democratization triggers political violence has been proposed repeatedly in the quantitative literature, but it remains controversial with respect to both interstate and civil wars. Current empirical research continues to be afflicted by methodological and data problems related to the measurement of democracy and the task of detecting changes in such scores. In order to gain further clarity into the link between democratization and civil war, the current study introduces a new period-finding algorithm that is able to detect periods of democratization and autocratization. This allows for a more flexible way of finding directional changes in governance indicators than is possible with the rigid lag structures commonly employed in previous studies. When regressed on various measures of civil-war onset, the indicator for the initiation of a period of democratization has a strong and robust effect on conflict even in the presence of static measures of regime type. The same applies to autocratization, but its impact is much more sudden than that of democratization. Moreover, we find that the democratization effect is limited to governmental rather than territorial conflicts. Further research will be needed to confirm these results in terms of the relevant causal mechanisms, especially in ethno-nationalist civil wars.},

results:
- koreans (more hierarchical culture) showed greater empathy for ingroup members + stronger activity in a brain region associated with mental state interference
-> activity in this region was assoiated with greater SDO and ingroup bias in empathy

- examined the possibility that neural regions associated with empathy underly the preference for human social hierarchy

method:
- fMRI, exposure to pictures of others in pain/no pain, SDO item battery

- in-depth interview of 30 respondents about civil rights and liberties
- people answer from the top of their head, framing and political knowledge matters
- respondents partly contradict in their evaluations/attitudes as they change between different frames/related considerations
- major difference across subjects lies in the way they reason through competing arguments -> true attitudes do not exist
-> knowledgeable are better to discuss different considerations
-> group-related considerations more important among those with less knowledge
=> knowledgeable respondents are more susceptible to framing, they know the common frames of reference, whereas less knowledgeable respondents improvize based on the given framework
=> given these results, interpretation of closed survey items seems problematic/difficult
- survey questions have to be changed, should ask people to think about the issue, maybe even provide possible considerations

propositions:
1) key understanding in the survey response lies in how people frame issues they are asked about
2) people choose frames off the top of their head
3) survey results can be biased by altering wording, format, context
4) notion of constitutional rights has strong influence on opinions
5) given enough time for reflection, people discuss multiple considerations

  comment   = {overview:
- This paper reviews the theoretical underpinnings of framing and extant empirical research.
- Framing can be illustrated within the expectancy value model. Attitude = sum_i(v_i * w_i) , where v_i is the evaluation of an attribute on dimension i, and wi is the weight placed on dimension i in the overall evaluation. Framing changes the w component. That is, it alters the considerations one focuses on when evaluating an object.
- In order for framing effects to occur, a given consideration must (a) be stored in memory and (b) be accessible and available for retrieval.
- Potential moderators of framing effects include predispositions, knowledge, and strength of the frame.
- Chong and Druckman argue that framing and priming can be made interchangeable within the expectancy value framework.

questions:
- One deficiency in the literature is the lack of a general understanding of what makes a frame strong (p. 117). What sort of measurable qualities of frames are there that might influence strength?
- The authors seem to have a negative view toward attitudes influenced by framing (“A `doorstep opinion’ or an opinion constructed ‘on the fly’ is not a real opinion if it is inseparable from the context in which it was elicited.” p. 119). Are framed attitudes necessarily non-attitudes?},

- personal self-interest does not explain political behavior, other factors such as group interests and values are more important
- broad definition of self interest (including group) vs. more narrow definition (only personal etc.)
- also feelings, psychic benefit
- classification: material interests vs. symbolic etc.
- several factors (like sociodemographics, income etc) do not affect policy opinions in the expected direction
- argue that narrow definition should be used, psychic benefit cannot be properly operationalized
=> narrow material self interest is not sufficient to explain policy preferences

conditions for the influence of self-interest
- consequences on choices on issue are: visible, tangible, large, certain
- individual differences in the tendency to base preferences on self-interest: machiavellianism, priority to economic comfort, perception of individual interests

comments:
- interesting argument: in politics, selfish actions are often viewed as illegitimate},

Fortunately, the task of designing experimental tests has proven tractable and the small, but growing, body of experimental evidence sheds new light on directional and proximity motivated behavior. The experiment described in this article was designed to reexamine the role of ideology structuring candidate evaluations in the general population and test the models in two new policy areas: opinion about military spending and opinion about abortion. The results indicate that ideology and opinions about military spending stimulate proximity behavior whereas opinions about abortion stimulate directional behavior. It is also found that abortion-based evaluations are more strongly directional for those who oppose abortion-which is consistent with the notion of policy balancing. The article concludes by considering the possibility that some issues lend themselves to proximity comparisons whereas others lend themselves to directional comparisons and discussing the implications for democratic politics.

But the ultimate result (which maximises the value of production) is independent of the legal position if the pricing system is assumed to work without cost." --> in the end, market rearrangements produce the same outcome and an increase in the value of production - the economic problem in all cases of harmful effects is how to maximise the value of production - however, if there are transaction costs, having the producer to pay the externalities can lead to suboptimal outcomes: "Once the costs of carrying out market transactions are taken into account it is clear that such a rearrangement of rights will only be undertaken when the increase in the value of production consequent upon the rearrangemen is greater than the costs which would be involved in bringing it about." - governmental regulations will not necessarily lead to better results - e.g. it can be problematic if the externalities are created by the gov't itself --> intervention goes to far in protecting those responsible - e.g. factory is taxed for pollution -> more people move there -> more taxes [-> not very good argument] - better approach: instead of taxing the producer one should take into account alternative social arrangements and the related opportunity costs [- however, some of his arguments are not completely convincible...] --> proper procedure is to compare the total social product yielded by different arrangements " The problem which we face in dealing with actions which have harmful effects is not simply one of restraining those responsible for them. What has to be decided is whether the gain from preventing the harm is greater than the loss which would be suffered elsewhere as a result of stopping the action which produces the harm."},

- easy arguments are short, simple, symbolic, conjure up readily accessible images, focus primarily on the consequences of a proposal, elicit stronger affect

Each experiment consists of a series of election periods in which dummy candidates choose spatial positions which represent either their policy while in office or a promise about policy if elected. Subjects (voters) are told the value to them of the incumbent's policy, but they must decide, prior to voting, whether or not to purchase information about the value of the challenger's promise. In general, our data conform to reasonable expectations: voters purchase less information and rely more on retrospective knowledge when the candidates' strategies are stable, and their likelihood of purchasing information during periods of instability is tempered by the likelihood that their votes matter, by the reliability of the information available for purchase, and by the degree of instability as measured by changes in each voter's welfare.},

Neither voters nor candidates are informed of the voter utility functions, and the only information received by the voter is the payoff he has received from the present and previous incumbent administrations.

While it is difficult to find proxies for grievances and opportunities, we find that political and social variables that are most obviously related to grievances have little explanatory power. By contrast, economic variables, which could proxy some grievances but are perhaps more obviously related to the viability of rebellion, provide considerably more explanatory power.},

  volume    = {25},
  comment   = {overview:
- investigation of liberal/conservative self-identification effect on political behavior and perception is based on two assumptions: 1) lib/con is bipolar in meaning, 2) underlying cognitive meaning based on social issues
- authors propose a model of ideological identification that emphasize symbolic and non-dimensional origins and nature
- empirical results suggest largely sympolical meaning of ideological identifications
-> you can develop reliable and valid measures of beliefs and that they are related to numerous political things 

meanings of ideology:
- individuals have different understandings of liberal and conservatives
- 2 meaning types: cognitive (-> rational/explicit ) vs. evaluative (-> symbolic, affective)

theoretical argument:
- political issues and attitudes can't be placed on a dimension (?)
- lib/con is not defined in bipolar terms, but rather based on different referents and concepts
- meaning of ideological labels is based on symbols rather than issues

Summary: 
What does ideological self-identification MEAN to individuals? How do individuals arrive at an ideological self-identification? First, ideology is not bi-directional. It seems that for individuals liberal does not necessarily mean the opposite of conservative (no bipolar continuum) – individuals interpret/define each end of the continuum separately. Second, the meaning of ideology is less policy issue based (cognitive) but largely symbolic (feeling towards different groups in society which constitute symbolic representations of the societal cleavages). [this reminds me on the expressive partisanship concept by Leonie; also, this work can be seen as a pre-runner for his 1988 paper, where symbols become more general values] Thus, using the ideology scale to measure issue-oriented thinking might be misleading. Also, symbols are easier cues than issues and thus ideological reasoning and ideological self-identification can take place absent real issue cleavages or the knowledge of issue positions [this contradicts Converse who regards the ideologues as sophisticated issue connoisseurs].

The authors suggest a causal ordering as follows: Individuals identify themselves as liberal or conservative depending on how they evaluate the labels “liberal” and “conservative” respectively (feeling thermometer towards the two). Evaluating one of them positively does not require evaluating the other negatively. The sources for the evaluation of the ideological labels themselves are issue positions and evaluation of the symbols, whereby the latter play a more dominant role.

Method: ANES data. The authors show that this causal ordering in a path model fits the data well. Also, they show that the data do not support the commonly assumed causal relationship: issue attitudes and symbols determine self-identification and evaluation of liberals and conservatives is a product then from self-identification (they show that identification is the result of evaluation of liberals and conservatives). Further, they show that evaluation of liberals and conservatives are not correlated and hence this is not a bipolar concept.},

  comment   = {conceptual issues:
- belief system instead of ideology -> ideology as a concept is too loose

ideological / belief system constraint
-> changes in one element necessitate changes in other connected elements
-> centrality: lower likelihood to change

sources of constraint:
1) logical: e.g. cut taxes and welfare increase -> but: political belief systems not necessarily logic
2) psychological: e.g. values, egalitarianism leads to support for welfare increase -> no necessarily based on pure logic
3) social: exposure to issue packages by elites / other people/groups ->
=> if there are constrained belief systems (ideologies) it is because of exposure to elites and their redderick (-> social constraint)

key predictions about constrained belief systems:
- constaint reflects elite debate: elite discourse should shape citizens' thinking -> if elites only talk about politics in terms of liberal/conservatives, so should the citizens
- elite structure as function of exposure/attention: people have to pay attention / comprehend in order to have constrained belief systems

1) levels of conceptualization:
- based on open-ended questions, likes and dislikes about parties
- levels of conceptualization: ideologues, near-ideologues, group-interest, nature of the times, no issue content

2) recognition and understanding of ideological dimensions
- more focused questions about how you define ideological dimensions
- people have learned that republicans are conservative and democrats are liberal but they are not very good at explaining why/how republicans are more conservative and vice versa
- people recognize ideological labels but they have little understanding of the underlying content

3) analysis of issue constraint:
- analysis of correlations between issue positions, comparing political elites (congressional candidates) and citizens
- extend to which individuals consistently hold liberal responses and vice versa
- only very weak constraint among masses
- centrality of abstract concepts vs. groups as central
-> but: what about heterogeneity/multidimensionality?

4) stability of issue positions (2 year gap)
- there is stability in party identification, but issue attitudes are not highly correlated b/w t1 and t2
- what about changes b/w both time points? -> Converse also looks at correlations b/w t1, t2, t3 -> all three possible correlations are about the same

issue publics:
- we might not find ideology, but maybe individuals specialize on specific issues, e.g. they only care about education policies and nothing else

questions/comments:
- Converse's work was time-bound, 60's/70's politics became more salient -> citizens became more ideological
- what happens if you take into account measurement error? -> Achen: opinions are stable if measurement error is account for},

definitions of public opinion
- simple aggregation of opinions? but: it can be argued that influence etc. is much more complex than a simple sum a la one person, one vote
- public opinion is what polls (try) to measure?
-> public opinion is embedded in complex sociopolitical process

view of public opinion:
- political community (politicians, journalists etc.) vs. public opinion researchers
-> growing acceptance etc.
-> but: there are still misconceptions among practitioners (e.g. in terms of faith in precision, stability of results, etc.)

public opinion vs effective political opinion
- both often converge, but they are far from being the same thing, sometimes diverge
- silent minority argument
- public opinion in polls and political outcomes / referenda can differ -> differential mobilization...

policy impact:
- difficult to assess influence of public opinion on politicians -> issues with conceptualization etc.
- measure congruence b/w popular opinion and policy outcomes -> considerable degree of congruence, but not perfect
- normative question: should legislators always follow opinion polls?

question:
- what do we want to measure if not the simple descriptive aggregation of individual opinions? everything else means that we have to make assumptions about the political process in order to aggegate opinions. however, this aggregation should not be assumed, but rather the subject of empirical study...},

- party success matters through it's reputation -> responsible party 
- parties maintain their reputations through agenda control and legislative success 
- majority party has more ability to control reputation (through setting the agenda) -> increse reputation by winning legislative battles 
- agenda setting: party tries to avoid divisive issues in order to prevent division of the party or legislative losses 
- but: current development contradicts that view to a certain extent, Boehner put a bill on the agenda and lost a couple of times

potential problems: 
- might become a non-falsifiable hypothesis -> post-hoc rationalization

difference to conditional party government: (<- check that again) 
- both theories are not really contradict each other, focus on different aspects 
- conditional party gov't as a more dynamic approach, looking at developments of the party systems 
- Cox/McCubbins: more stationary theory, relevance of setting the agenda, development doesn't matter that much

Summary:
Because the majority party controls the agenda, they create a procedural cartel in which key aspects of the agenda are manipulated/monopolized by the majority party. Cartels exist when legislatures are busy, special agenda-setting powers are delegated to various offices (where majority members hold these positions), and senior majority members don’t push legislation that their party doesn’t want. Based on CPG, procedural cartel theory says majority uses positive agenda power (pushing bills through legislature, allocating proposal rights) and negative agenda power (ability to block bills from floor, veto rights). This assumes that legislative accomplishment leads to increased party ‘brand name’, which leads to members being reelected. The more loyal one is to one’s party they more likely they are to be appointed to desirable committees. Message: Agenda control is the key to majority party’s influence over the legislative process.},

 -> Implicit and explicit components of whites’ feelings of closeness, and people may hold more than one set of implicit attitudes: culturally shared & idiosyncratic.
 -> Culturally shared should not related to explicit
 -> Idiosyncratic should be related to explicit

Methods
- 555 SBU undergrads: 47% W, 10% B, 11% H, 24% A, 8% other
- DV: Pro-Black policy support
- Measured both implicit and explicit feelings of closeness toward African Americans – measured both early and late in experiment.
- Explicit measure: How close do you feel toward African/White Americans?
- Implicit closeness measure: Based on “cognitive self-other overlap” – representation of one’s self can overlap with representations of others if there is a psychological bond.
- Timed trait self-rating procedure (Aron et al. 1991).
 1. Initial trait survey – rate self and other groups on 90 traits
 2. Timed self-rating task – only relates to the self, no reference to racial groups; participants respond as quickly as possible indicating whether the 90 traits are self-descriptive or not.
- Facilitation for traits descriptive of self AND close groups, inhibition for mismatched traits with close groups, opposite for distant groups.

Results: 
- Prediction 1 – Runs a Granger-causality model to test the causal relationship between explicit and implicit closeness (both measured early and late in experiment). Finds that change in implicit closeness from time 1 to time 2 cause changes in explicit closeness from time 1 to time 2. However, explicit closeness does not cause changes in implicit closeness. This supports the validity of the measure.
- Prediction 2 - Implicit closeness toward African Americans contributes to the prediction of pro-Black policy support independently of explicit closeness and regardless of racial group membership, controlling for ideology, party ID, motivation to control prejudice, and race. Consistent with the idea that group membership is independent of feelings of closeness toward a given group, race is not statistically significant, and implicit feelings of closeness toward blacks retains its significance in a whites-only model.
- Prediction 3 – In-group favoritism (via Social Identity Theory) emerges in explicit closeness, but not implicit closeness. On the explicit measure, subjects overstated their closeness with their own racial group and understated their closeness to the racial out-group. No such difference appears on the implicit measure. The creation of a social identity is a conscious process, not an implicit one. 

Conclusions/Why do we care?
- Group membership is not necessary for fostering feelings of closeness toward a group or support for policies benefiting that group.
- Ingroup favoritism may be the result of a conscious process, and not necessarily a default setting. 
- Implicit closeness is a valid measure of unconscious racial attitudes that is not influenced by social desirability, pressure to control prejudice, or group membership. This implicit attitude has substantive causal effects on one’s explicit attitude and policy preferences.
- People hold both culturally shared and idiosyncratic components to implicit attitudes. Traditional implicit measures (e.g., IAT, priming) may only be capturing the culturally shared component, which makes the implicit closeness measure superior.},

This difference remains after controlling for selection (those that choose the policy may be more likely to be affected by it). We conclude that the treatment effect of policies may depend on whether they are endogenous or exogenous to the society on which they are imposed. Therefore, democratic institutions may have an effect on behavior in addition to the effect in terms of policy choice. More generally, our findings have implications for empirical studies of treatment effects in other contexts: the effect of a treatment may depend on whether it is endogenous or exogenous.},

We find that the American press does not present clear and singular messages about presidential elections but, rather, multiple messages about the candidates and the campaign. In addition, perception of the information is shaped as much by an individual's political views as by the objective content. Despite the mixed messages, we find that a newspaper's editorial content is significantly related to candidate preferences in 1992. These results challenge the minimal effects interpretation of the media, because local newspapers can play a significant role in providing cues that influence voters' electoral calculus.},

Building on Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, Siverson, and Morrowï¿½s selectorate theory, the model here examines the policy responses of office-seeking leaders to revolutionary threats. Whether leaders suppress public goods such as freedom of assembly and freedom of information to hinder the organizational ability of potential revolutionaries or appease potential evolutionaries by increasing the provision of public goods depends, in part, on the sources of government revenues. Empirical tests show that governments with access to revenue sources that require few labor inputs by the citizens, such as natural resource rents or foreign aid, reduce the provision of public goods and increase the odds of increased authoritarianism in the face of revolutionary pressures. In contrast, without these sources of unearned revenues, governments respond to revolutionary pressures by increasing the provision of public goods and democratizing.},

- conscientiousness -> conservative ideology 
- extraversion and neuroticism do not have significant effects any more, once family clusters are taken into account 
- influence of childhood experience -> direct effect on ideology 
- significant interaction between childhood trauma and openness to experience

analysis: 
1) personality -> ideology: openness, conscientiousness have effects; extraversion, neuroticism only if sibling clusters are not taken into account 
2) childhood experiences -> ideology: childhood trauma and number of friends significant after including all experiences in one equation (school + neighborhood insecurity not) 
3) interaction b/w childhood experiences and personality: openness X trauma 
4) mediation / moderated mediation analysis of openness + trauma: openness appears to be the more dominant influence

questions: 
- it would be interesting to see whether there are indeed effects of extraversion and neuroticism if the analysis takes into account the facets of each trait or looks at a multi-dimensional conceptualization of ideology 
- why is childhood experience a moderator of the effect of personality on ideology rather than shaping personality itself? -> theoretical explanation? 
-> actually the argument should be reverse: personality moderates the effect of childhood experiences on ideology 
- author mixes arguments about moderation with mediation... moderation does not imply mediation -> unclear distinction by author 
- what about direct effects of childhood experience on ideology? 
- openness trait is positively related to traumatic experience -> could this be a self-report problem?},

For two decades, the American National Election Studies asked open-ended questions about political knowledge and coded answers using procedures that are neither reliable nor replicable and that were never shown to be optimally valid. Consequently, conclusions based on these widely used measures of the publicï¿½s competence are in doubt. This article presents several new and overdue methodological improvements: coding knowledge data using formal and specific coding rules based on a substantive rationale for the validity of the codes, recognizing partially correct answers, using multiple coders working independently, using machine coding, and testing reliability and validity. The new methods are an improvement because they are transparent and replicable and they produce valid and extremely reliable knowledge data. Further, machine coding produces codes nearly identical to those from a team of human coders, at much lower cost.},

Reanalysis of the Fowler and Dawes data by Charney and English, based on four critiques of candidate gene studies, led to the conclusion that neither polymorphism is related to variations in turnout. We add to this empirical debate by conducting an independent test using an original dataset containing 5-HTT data and two separate participation variables: self-reported participation and actual voting records. Our results confirm the original conclusions by Fowler and Dawes on 5-HTT, but also support several of the critiques suggested by Charney and English. We conclude by offering suggestions for the way candidate gene association studies should be interpreted by the discipline and processed by journal editors.},

  abstract  = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of trust, cynicism and efficacy on young peoples' (non)voting behaviour during the 2005 British general election. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data were gathered from 1,134 interviewer-administered questionnaires with young first-time voters during the three-week period following the British general election in May 2005. Validated attitudes statements were used to measure their levels of trust, cynicism and efficacy. Findings - The research shows that young people are generally distrusting of and very cynical about politicians and the Prime Minister (Tony Blair) Thus, in part, the data support the existing evidence that cynicism contributes to feelings of political alienation. However, the paper's findings also indicate that while young people can be highly distrusting and cynical, they can also be interested in the election and vote. Research limitations/implications - Current, negative evaluations of young people and electoral politics need to be reviewed. While, it cannot be denied that this age group are highly cynical, and their electoral participation is in decline, for some, this cynicism, when combined with personal efficacy, can act as a positive force to stimulate ``monitorial{''} interaction with election offerings. Consequently, further research is needed to understand young peoples' perceptions of democracy and electoral politics, how their personal efficacy can be increased and what feeds their cynicism. Originality/value - This paper offers a contemporary understanding of young people as an interested and critical citizenry and raises a number of important questions that set a new agenda for political marketers researching youth electoral engagement in the future.},

  comment   = {overview:
- distinction between knowledge of cultural stereotypes and acceptance/endorsement of the stereotype
- stereotypes are a product of common socialization experiences and therefore activated automatically, but the endorsement/personal belief can be consciously controlled given sufficient time and cognitive capacity
- automatic attitudes reflect culturally shared stereotypes; low-prejudiced individuals inhibit/control sterotypes when reporting their beliefs
-> attitude change and belief process requires intention, attention, and time

results:
study 1) sterotype content and prejudice level: high- and low-prejudiced individuals are equally knowledgeable of cultural sterotypes (subjects are asked to list stereotypes regarding Blacks irrespective of their opinion)
study 2) automatic/attentionless priming: automatic racial stereotype priming outside of conscious awareness affects evaluation of ambiguous stereotype-relevant behaviors among high- and low-prejudiced participants (behavior is judged to be more hostile)
study 3) controlled processes and prejudice level: low-prejudiced subjects engage in controlled processes to inhibit prejudiced responses (subjects are asked about their thoughts about the racial group Blacks)

Take Home: 
Although someone might have a negative implicit attitude they can explicitly control it. It’s really hard to unlearn something at the implicit level, even if you can acknowledge that it is invalid at the conscious level. When prejudiced attitudes are automatically recalled one can stereotype-congruent responses by ‘overriding’ these negative thoughts with thoughts of egalitarianism. This is essentially like breaking a bad habit.},

  comment   = {basic argument: 
- parallels b/w stability/plasticity and ego-control/ego-resiliency

-> argues for theory of Big Five (B5) as an adaptive system

ego-control/ego-resiliency: 
- personality as adaptive system / affect processing system -> allow organism to survive 
- ego-control: control impulses 
- ego-resiliency: modify current level of ego-control

stability/plasticity: 
- metatraits of B5 
- personality as goal-directed cybernetic system 
- stability (Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, low Neuroticism): ability to avoid disruption 
- plasticity (Extraversion and Openness/Intellect): exploratory tendency

=> "We posit that Stability and Plasticity reflect between-person variation in the mechanisms that fulfill two basic needs of any cybernetic system existing in an environment that is not fully predictable"

1) maintain stability of own functioning 
2) adapt to changing circumstances

evaluate similarity b/w bot conceptualizations: 
1) theory: quite similar 
2) operationalization in questionnaires: some overlapping items, some not 
3) association with other constructs: suggests that constructs ego-control/ego-resiliency may be rotation in relation to stability/plasticity 
-> but it's a little more complicated, ego-control/ego-resiliency are linked

=> steps to integrate B5 in an adaptive system: 
1) identify psychological mechanisms that unify the traits encompassed in each of the B5 
2) integrate mechanisms in a cybernetic system 
- three processes: being motivated to act + selecting an action + carrying out action 
-> each trait may be relevant to multiple stages of the process

questions: 
- interesting motivational underpinning of B5, but why does it translate to 5 specific factors? unclear connection between functions and individual factors},

- investigated the number of factors present within the facets of the two major big five personality questionnaires 
- hyp: most likely result for each domain is a two-factor solution -> supported 

-> 2 (correlated) factors for each personality dimension: 
- Openess/Intellect: Openess + Intellect 
- Extraversion: Assertiveness + Enthusiasm 
- Conscientousness: Indoustriousness + Orderliness 
- Agreeableness: Compassion + Politeness 
- Neuroticism: Volatility + Withdrawal

Study 2 
- justification for interpretation of sub-factors -> precise characterization of the aspect factors 
- creation of an instrument to measure the 10 aspects of the big five

- interpretation consistent with Big Five Aspect Scales (BFAS) -> BFAS is a good representation of the 2 facets, averaging both provides a good representation of B5 
- interesting: correlations b/w aspects more varied than correlations across domains 
- signs for suppression: two domains might not correlate, but individual facets do (cancel each other out in aggregate)

Study 3 
- how well do the phenotypic factors correspond to genetic factors?

- genetic factors: also two factor fit best for each domain 
- hyp: within each domain, each phenotypic factor correlates most strongly with a different genetic factor -> supported 
-> high degree of correspondence b/w both sets of factors

Discussion: 
- interesting results, study 3 hints to underlying genetic factors that determine personality differences 
- q: is it possible that the differentiation in 2 factets represents a third dimension which is independent of the B5?},

- short review explaining the negative relationship b/w cognitive abilities and prejudice
- low cognitive ability -> right-wing socially conservative attitudes -> prejudice
- description of Cognitive Ability and Style to Evaluation model (CASE) to integrate different findings and approaches

explanation for negative relationship b/w cognitive abilities and prejudice:
- right-wing conservatism minimizes complexity and increases perceived control
-> attractive for individuals who are motivated to avoid ambiguity and uncertainty in preference for predictability and simplicity
-> this explains the connection between low cognitive ability and RW attitudes
- right-wing ideologies, in turn, predict prejudice etc.
=> low cognitive ability -> RW ideologies -> prejudicial attitudes

Cognitive Ability and Style to Evaluation model (CASE)
- cognitive ability + style -> threat perceptions -> prevention vs. promotion focus -> right-wing ideologies -> stereotyping. prejudice etc.
- additional cycle: right-wing ideologies -> threat perceptions
-> therefore, some aspects in the model mutually reinforce each other

Subjects are randomly assigned to three roles: a proposer and two types of voters. Each role is randomly assigned a disagreement value, i.e. a given amount of money he/she will receive if the proposal is rejected. These values are known to all players before any decision is made. Proposers then make a take-it-or-leave-it offer on how to split a fixed, known amount of money among the players. If a majority of players accepts the proposal, the players' payoffs are determined by the proposal; if the proposal is rejected, each player receives his or her reservation value. We assess the ability of three behavioral hypotheses ï¿½ self-interest, egalitarianism, and inequality-aversion ï¿½ to account for our results. Our primary design variable is the proposer's reservation value, which allows us to obtain different implications from each hypothesis. We find that each hypothesis is inconsistent with our data in important respects. However, subjects strongly respond to changes in reservation values as if they were interpreted as a basic form of entitlement.},

Main Question:
How does conscious and automatic processing aﬀect the quality and accuracy of decision-making?

Approach & Method:
Laboratory and ﬁeld studies on consumer choice; investigation of quality of decision and post-choice satisfaction.

Results: 
Original studies conﬁrmed the deliberation without attention hypothesis: simple choices (such as between diﬀerent towels or diﬀerent sets of oven mitts) indeed produce better results after conscious thought, but for choices in complex matters (such as between diﬀerent houses or diﬀerent cars), unconscious processing performs better. However, Payne et al. argue that one has to further account for the interaction between forms of processing and choice environments when considering how to approach complex choice problems: self-paced conscious thought can perform better than unconscious thought, e.g. when the decision task depends on questions of magnitude.

summary:
Conscious thinkers were better able to make the best choice among simple products where unconscious thinkers did in complex products. For people who knew about the product before they went shopping, the amount of conscious thought was positively related to postchoice satisfaction for simple products and negatively related to satisfaction for complex products.},

Furthermore, many puzzles and contradictions in the existing research literature have barely been examined. The review concludes that while there is embryonic consensus on the effects of a small set of variables, there is not yet a widely accepted theory that explains these effects. Since neither qualitative nor quantitative analysis of civil wars has solved these puzzles, future studies of civil war onset should theorize the expected interactions between all variables of interest, collect data on variables with poor proxies, take grievances more seriously in theory and measurement, make use of the enormous quantity of historical scholarship on civil wars, and extend the concept of ``multiple paths to war{''} to intrastate war.},

- physiological and attentional responses to aversive and appetitive stimuli -> correlated with broad political orientations 
- on average, aversive aspects more influential (-> risk aversity), but: there is individual variation in relative importance etc.

skin conductance & attention bias (via eye-tracking) response: 
- aversive stimuli (negative pictures / candidates of opposite party): rigth-of-the-center react stronger 
- appetitive stimuli (positive pictures / candidates of same party): left-of-the-center react stronger (-> relative)

Questions: 
- what about the causal direction? 
- personality as underlying factor for both, orientation towards stimuli as well as political orientation? 
- what about differences in laboratory/white collar effects? what about social desireability?

Interesting conclusion: 
Demonstrating that those on the right not only respond more strongly to aversive images but also devote more attention to aversive images suggests a different and perhaps less value-charged interpretation of those holding right-of-centre political orientations. It appears individuals on the political right are not so much 'fearful' and 'vulnerable' as attuned and attentive to the aversive in life.},

  comment   = {overview:
- rational choice perspective -> voters choose party to maximize utility
- parties choose their platform in order to get elected -> move to the median in the two-party system 
- Imperfect information causes people not to vote -> voters don't see as much difference in the parties, hence it is more likely that the cost of voting exceeds the expected payout of voting (utility they derive if their party wins * probability that they are the deciding factor)
- outparty can win by adopting a popular position, perfectly mirroring the party in charge, or by aggregating aggrieved minorities.
- Downs hypothesizes that democracies act rationally to maximize political support (in order to gain political or economic ends). Rational acting government pursues its goals under three conditions: democratic structure where opposition parties exist, atmosphere of degrees of uncertainty, and an electorate of rational voters. The main goal of every party is winning elections, therefore maximizing votes and creating policies are a means to an end. Voters and government rely on a circular relationship of mutual interdependence in order for a democracy to function. Uncertainty forces rational governments to regard some voters as more important than others because uncertainty = persuasion techniques = competition (interest groups, favor-buyers). Uncertainty leads voters to align themselves with a certain ideology, which essentially cuts their information costs (this is irrational voting). A nation’s political development is based upon its distribution of voters (parties in a two-party system have a wider variance of ideology/policies) and whether its structure is based on plurality or proportional representation.

  comment   = {overview:
- argues against the notion that framing effects are clear evidence of citizen competence
- evidence suggests some isolated cases of incompetence, citizens often use frames in a competent and well-reasoned manner

requirements for citizen competence:
1) preference invariance (should not be based on arbitrary aspects)
2) should not be based on elite manipulation -> elite influence should not occur automatically

2 types of frames:
1) frames in communication: words, images, etc. that a speaker uses when relating information to another
2) frames thought: an individual's (cognitive) understanding of a given situation
framing effect: frames in communication -> frames in thought

2 types of framing effects:
1) equivalency framing effect: alter preferences due to different but logically equivalent words/phrases (see also survey wording)
-> indicates incompetence because it violates preference invariance + potential for elite manipulation
-> but: effects only occur under very specific conditions (strength of attitude, involvement etc.)
-> equivalency framing can be limited through the relying on party cues to overcome framing effects
2) emphasis framing effect: emphasizing subset of relevant considerations
-> does not violate invariance principle (really?), but potentially indicates elite manipulation if frames work automatically
-> but: effects do not work through automatic but rather conscious deliberative process weighting importance of considerations
-> emphasis framing is limited through predispositions, deliberation/discussion, amount of political information, source credibility, competition over frames},

- framing effects are not as robust as previously thought, they only occur under certain conditions -> focus on equivalency framing (as opposed to issue/emphasis framing)
- counter-framing and deliberation decreases/diminishes the effects of the initial frame
- experts are less susceptible to framing effects

experimental design:
- 4 equivalency frames (classic examples of logically equivalent frames, e.g. choose b/w people surviving and people dying)
- counter-framing conditions: provide the alternativ frame of the problem as well
- homogeneous/heterogeneous groups discussion -> people with the same or different framing conditions
- groups of four, discussed the issue for 5 minutes after each participant describes the problem

comments:
- knowledge/expertise effect is the exact opposite from the Druckman/Nelson (2203, AJPS) finding... yet Druckman argues that both make theoretically sense. Smells like post-hoc rationalization of significant results
- same argument as Druckman/Nelson (2003, AJPS), but now looking at equivalency frames rather than issue framing},

- The main question is the impact of factual information compared to framing effects in opinion formation. This is examined in the context of two emergent technologies: carbon-nanotubes and genetically modified foods.
- The authors hypothesize that facts will not have a significantly greater impact than frames without factual information. There are other hypotheses predicting various motivated reasoning effects stemming from the initial framing of the technologies.
- An experiment was administered that assigned several different combinations of frames and facts. A follow-up test was administered at a later date to test the hypotheses concerning motivated reasoning.
- Results indicate that “facts do not enhance frame strength” (p. 681). There is also evidence of biased processing once individuals form their initial opinions.
- Question: Is it possible to present frames without any factual content?
- Question: Is there a first-mover advantage when it comes to framing issues or events?},

- framing effects are relatively short-lived

discussion of prior evidence on conversation effects:
(1) group discussions have framing effects
(2) cross-cutting groups have de-polarizing effect
(3) homogeneous groups have polarizing effect

individual moderators:
- knowledge increases framing effects
- prior opinion (-> need to evaluate -> on-line processing ?!) decreases framing effects

experimental design:
- framing (news articles on campaign finance reform with a focus on free speech vs. special interests
- group discussion (3-4 participants), vary homogeneous vs. heterogeneous framing

- interesting starting point for experimental design
- GOOD CITES (to check for prospectus!)

  abstract  = {Competition is a defining element of democracy. One of the most noteworthy events over the last quarter-century in U.S. politics is the change in the nature of elite party competition: The parties have become increasingly polarized. Scholars and pundits actively debate how these elite patterns influence polarization among the public (e.g., have citizens also become more ideologically polarized?). Yet, few have addressed what we see as perhaps more fundamental questions: Has elite polarization altered the way citizens arrive at their policy opinions in the first place and, if so, in what ways? We address these questions with a theory and two survey experiments (on the issues of drilling and immigration). We find stark evidence that polarized environments fundamentally change how citizens make decisions. Specifically, polarization intensifies the impact of party endorsements on opinions, decreases the impact of substantive information and, perhaps ironically, stimulates greater confidence in those-less substantively grounded-opinions. We discuss the implications for public opinion formation and the nature of democratic competition.},

  abstract  = {We report results from a laboratory experiment testing the basic hypothesis embedded in various rational voter models that there is a direct correlation between the strength of an individual's belief that his or her vote will be pivotal and the likelihood that individual incurs the cost to vote. This belief is typically unobservable. In one of our experimental treatments we elicit these subjective beliefs using a proper scoring rule that induces truthful revelation of beliefs. This allows us to directly test the pivotal voter model. We find that a higher subjective probability of being pivotal increases the likelihood that an individual votes, but the probability thresholds used by subjects are not as crisp as the theory would predict. There is some evidence that individuals learn over time to adjust their beliefs to be more consistent with the historical frequency of pivotality. However, many subjects keep substantially overestimating their probability of being pivotal.},

The contributions to this special issue of Journal of Conflict Resolution help to bridge this gap, through explicit theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between fighting and voting. Armed conflict and electoral politics may be strategic substitutes, in that political actors may optimally choose to submit to the ballot box or instead attempt to impose their will by force; or they may be strategic complements, in that actors use violence to bolster their electoral aims, or use electoral returns as sources of information on underlying preferences that they exploit in armed campaigns. In either case, the distribution of popular support for contending parties can shape not only the incidence but also the type of armed conflict, and it can also influence the incentives of parties to invest in institutional mechanisms that mitigate commitment problems and help to bring violent conflicts to an end. The contributions to this issue illuminate these themes and demonstrate the value of bringing these separate research programs into closer dialogue.},

We first overcome the problem of irregular and infrequent measurement of attitudes toward the Supreme Court by employing an approach developed by Stimson (1991) which allows us to pool seventeen similar survey items administered a total of ninety-three times to produce a single, semi-annual time series of support for the Supreme Court, extending from 1973 through 1993. We then consider the effect of the Court's ideological position on the level of support it enjoys. In contrast to previous research, we take into account that both the Court's and the public's ideological preferences vary over time. Our analysis indicates that the public's appraisal of the Supreme Court responds not to the Court's ideological position per se, but rather to the extent to which the Court's position diverges from the ideological preferences of the citizenry; when the Court deviates from the public mood, its support erodes},

In addition, this gender-congeniality effect was present among Republican and independent participants but absent among Democratic participants because Democratic men as well as women favored candidates who advocated the positions typically favored by women. Interpretation invoked the importance of group interest based on gender as an influence on women's voting.

  comment   = {Overview:
The current series of experiments builds on the previous literature regarding the automaticity of positive/negative attitudes in the face of incidental cues. For example, Bargh et al. (1996) found that subconscious exposure of Black faces automatically activated negative stereotypes associated with Blacks in society. The experiments also build on the previous literature regarding the effects of exposure to national symbols such as the American flag. Butz, Plant, & Doerr (2007) found that exposure to the American flag activated nationalistic sentiments which affected subsequent attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups. 
-> The current series of experiments test the following hypotheses regarding exposure to the Confederate flag among Southern voters:
- Exposure to the Confederate flag will affect willingness to vote for Barack Obama, relative to White candidates
- Exposure to the Confederate flag produces negative evaluations of Black targets
- Exposure to the Confederate flag increased accessibility of racial attitudes

Study 1:
- Subjects complete a pre-experiment questionnaire that includes partisan identification and evaluations of Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton, Mike Huckabee, and John McCain (including a ‘willingness to vote for’ measure)
- Subjects completed a lexical decision task that included subliminal priming of either the Confederate flag or a neutral control object “made up of colored lines”
- Subjects completed a post-experiment questionnaire where they were shown pictures of each of the four candidates and asked how likely they would vote for each candidate on a 1-9 scale

Study 2:
- Subjects were either exposed to the Confederate flag or not via the placement of a notebook that was either blank or had the Confederate flag sticker 
- Subjects were asked to read a story about a hypothetical Black man and then were given a series of positive/negative traits and were asked to rate how well each trait described him
- Subjects were asked to complete an abbreviated version of the Attitudes Toward Blacks scale

Key Results Study 1:
- Exposure to the Confederate flag led White participants to report lowered likelihood of voting for Obama, but did NOT result in an increase in overall conservatism
- Exposure to the flag had no impact on either White or Black participants’ reported likelihood of voting for either McCain or Huckabee
- No significant effect of flag exposure on post-experiment levels of either liberalism or conservatism (measured separately)
- No significant interaction between exposure to the flag and identifying as a Southerner (dichotomized measure of 1-7 score)

Key Results Study 2:
- Participants exposed to the flag rated the hypothetical Black man more negatively than those not exposed to the flag
- These effects were not dependent upon pre-existing levels of racism (measured by the ABT scale)

Why is this important?
In addition to further contributing to the existing literature that explores the automaticity of racial attitudes in the face of incidental cues, the experiments conducted here provide an additional context for the activation of such attitudes. By merely being exposed to the Confederate flag (both subconsciously and implicitly), subjects in the experiments were less likely to vote for an African-American candidate, regardless of partisanship. In addition, subjects were also more likely to evaluate a hypothetical Black man negatively, regardless of a lack in pre-existing racial bias.},

  abstract  = {To say that positive political theory (PPT) scholarship on the hierarchy of justiceis theory rich and data poor is to make a rather uncontroversial claim. For over a decade now, scholars have offered intriguing theoretical accounts aimed at understanding why lower courts defy (comply with) higher courts. But only rarely do they subject the accounts to rigorous empirical interrogation. The chief obstacle, it seems, is the lack of areliableandvalidmeasurement strategy for placing judges of lower courts and justices of higher courts in the same policy space. Without such a strategy, we can systematically test few, if any, hypotheses flowing from PPT models of the judicial hierarchy. With such an approach not only can we investigate the implications of these models, we can assess many others flowing from the larger PPT program on judging, as well. It is to the challenge of scaling judges and justices (as well as legislatures and executives) that we turn in this article. We begin by explicating our measurement strategy, and then by explaining its advantages over previous efforts. Next we explore the results of our approach and provide a descriptive look at data it yields: a ï¿½ï¿½Judicial Common Spaceï¿½ï¿½ (JCS) score for all justices and judges appointed since 1953. The last section offers three applications designed to shore up the suitability and adaptability of the JCS for a range of positive projects on the courts.},

- distinction b/w individual level inconsistencies and aggregate-level behavior
-> random choices of uninformed voters cancel out

- relationship b/w economic performance, content of enacted policies, and presidential approval, public mood, and partisanship

-> more rationality and predictability to American politics when viewed in the aggregate than one might infer from considering only the limited political awareness of the average citizen
- reasons: errors cancel out, aggregate changes are determined by informed voters, small individual changes can loom large in the aggregate

- macropartisanship and public mood (demand for lib/con policies) varies in predictable ways

- three variables predicting presidential elections:
1) macropartisanship
2) ideological mood
3) candidate ideology, determines the proximity of median voter to each candidate

-> macropartisanship, mood, and mean platform liberalism explain a large share of the variance in vote
-> economic growth adds no further statistical information -> economic effect is indirect, subsumed by the other factors

- same model also predicts congressional elections (to lesser extendt), especially in presidential election years

=> many good ideas / hypotheses, but no good hypotheses tests

========================================================

Chapter 3
- argue for prospective sociotropic economic voting rather than retrospective (bankers instead of peasants)
- subjective evaluations rather than objective indicators matter
-> voters respond in terms of their expectations of the future level of prosperity

Chapter 6
- policy mood: aggregated policy preferences -> relatively stable preferenc3e for more or less gov't
-> move in coherent fashion, responds to changes in the economy (high inflation -> conservatism, high unemployment -> liberalism)

Chapter 8-9
- policy making / policy activity -> responds to changes in public mood
- laws -> policy responds to public mood (with some delay), ideological demand responds to policy change (with some smaller delay)

Chapoter 10
- american macro politics: a system model -> combining previous arguments in an overall model/framework (?)

It is this perceived responsiveness-captured by the probability that the government gives in and accepts a proposed change in ethnic policy-that induces individuals to mobilize, often violently, to support their cause. Yet, mobilization is costly and militants have to be compensated accordingly. The model allows for both financial and human contributions to conflict and allows for a variety of individual attitudes ({''}radicalism{''}) towards the cause. The main results concern the effects of within-group heterogeneity in radicalism and income, as well as the correlation between radicalism and income, in precipitating conflict.},

The current findings, through both mediation and moderation, also highlight the central role that the sense of power plays in producing these decision-making tendencies. First, sense of power, but not mood, mediated the link between power and overconfidence (Experiment 3).

- Critique Modern Racism scale as an instrument which gauges one’s willingness to express negativity towards blacks. Overall, they support Devine’s argument by saying that ppl can control their judgments. 
- pg 1025. “We believe that the MODE model (Fazio, 1990) provides a useful theoretical framework for considering the influence of automatic and controlled processes in race-related judgments and behavior (see Dovidio & Fazio, 1992). As noted earlier, the model asserts that motivation is necessary to engage in the cognitive effort required to counter any automatically activated negativity. In this particular domain, the relevant motivation concerns a desire to control and avoid seemingly prejudiced responses. Whether this motivation is engaged in any given situation will depend on individuals' construal of the situation and the judgmental or behavioral response that is being requested of them. Construing the situation and requested response as related to their racial attitudes will evoke such motivation among any individuals who share these concerns.”
- Take Home: Expression of explicit attitudes is based upon motivation to control/not control implicit attitude. Motivation depends on one’s construal of the situation and the judgment/behavior being asked of them. More importantly, opportunity to control implicit negativity is key in determining whether one will be motivated to do so.},

- Talks about the IAT and the mechanisms that underlie it (accessibility between two concepts in memory). They say that exp/imp research implies dual ‘tudes but they critique this by noting that explicit atts are probably not independent of imp atts. Say imp/exp attitude lit has been relatively atheoretical.
- Briefly highlights their MODE model: (pg. 301) “The MODE model’s focus on the processes by which attitudes influence judgments and behavior makes it especially relevant to the present concerns. In brief, the model proposes that attitudes can exert influence through relatively spontaneous or more deliberative processes. The former involve judgments of, or behavior toward, an object being influenced by one’s construal of the object in the immediate situation—perceptions that themselves can be affected by individuals’ attitudes having been automatically activated upon encountering the attitude object. In contrast, deliberative processing involves a more effortful, cost-benefit analysis of the utility of a particular behavior. MODE is an acronym for motivation and opportunity as determinants of whether the attitude-to-behavior process is primarily spontaneous or deliberative in nature. Given the effortful reflection required for deliberative processing, some motivating force is necessary to induce individuals to engage in the processing.“
- (pg.304) “The MODE model suggests that the magnitude of the relation between an implicit and an explicit measure will depend on the motivation and opportunity to deliberate. If either motivation or opportunity is relatively low at the time that the explicit response is being considered, then explicit measures should correlate with implicit ones. However, when both motivation and opportunity are relatively high, they are less likely to correlate (see Koole et al. 2001 for evidence on the relevance of opportunity factors to the relation between implicitly and explicitly measured self-esteem).”},

The author shows that this result is quite fragile, even using Collier and Hoeffler's data. Minor changes in the sample framing and the recovery of missing data undermine it. To the extent that there is an association, it is likely because oil is a major component of primary commodity exports and substantial oil production does associate with civil war risk. The author argues that oil predicts civil war risk not because it provides an easy source of rebel start-up finance but probably because oil producers have relatively low state capabilities given their level of per capita income and because oil makes state or regional control a tempting ``prize.{''} An analysis of data on government observance of contracts and investor-perceived expropriation risk is consistent with this hypothesis.},

We show that the current prevalence of internal war is mainly the result of a steady accumulation of protracted conflicts since the 1950s and 1960s rather than a sudden change associated with a new, post-Cold War international system. We also find that after controlling for per capita income, more ethnically or religiously diverse countries have been no more likely to experience significant civil violence in this period. We argue for understanding civil war in this period in terms of insurgency or rural guerrilla warfare, a particular form of military practice that can be harnessed to diverse political agendas. The factors that explain which countries have been at risk for civil war are not their ethnic or religious characteristics but rather the conditions that favor insurgency. These include poverty-which marks financially and bureaucratically weak states and also favors rebel recruitment-political instability, rough terrain, and large populations.},

This bias can result from ethical expressive preferences, which include a payoff voters obtain from taking an action they believe to be ethical. In large elections, pivot probability is small, so expressive preferences become more important relative to material self-interest. Ethical expressive preferences can have a disproportionate impact on results in large elections for two reasons. As pivot probability declines, ethical expressive motivations make agents more likely to vote on the basis of ethical considerations than on the basis of narrow self-interest, and the set of agents who choose to vote increasingly consist of agents with large ethical expressive payoffs. We provide experimental evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis of moral bias.},

  comment   = {The data (GSS, NES, Welfare mother experiment reinforced the traditional notion of a negative relationship between education and racial hostility. However, the improved ability to connect predispositions with policy attitudes provided by education may help both those with positive and negative perceptions of blacks adopt policy attitudes consistent with their racial attitudes. That is why data also shows that the relationship between racial perceptions and attitudes toward welfare (i.e., the use of race as an implicit policy cue) is stronger among the very same well-educated individuals. 

The results suggest that: the discursively-mediated cognitive link between welfare and stereotypes of blacks may not be weaker among the well-educated, despite the well-established “main effect” relationship between education and racial tolerance 

Intellectual origins:
- a long line of work has indicated that the attitudes of the well-educated are generally more tightly bundled, across many domains (Converse 1964; Judd et al. 1981; Zaller 1992). 
- “special favors” tend to be more opposed to welfare, even after a variety of nonracial predispositions relevant to welfare attitudes are taken into account (Gilens 1999). 
- work on the psychology of implicit racial appeals (Mendelberg 2001) 
- education may allow citizens to substitute race-neutral considerations for directly racial ones in their policy reasoning (Sniderman and Piazza 1993) 
- consistent with arguments made by the general group-dominance model (e.g., Federico and Sidanius 2002a, 2002b; Sidanius, Pratto, and Bobo 1996) and the various “new racism” models (e.g., Sears et al. 1997) about the origins of whites’ policy attitudes, both of which suggest that race-related attitudinal dimensions continue to have an active policy impact among the poorly educated and well-educated alike

Description of experiment:
a hypothetical woman in “her early thirties with a ten-year-old child” who “has been on welfare for the past year” under one of two randomly assigned question-wording conditions. Half of the sample was told that the recipient was a “white woman” while the other half was told that the recipient was a “black woman”. Respondents then answered two questions about the hypothetical welfare mother: (1) how likely it was that she would “try really hard to find a job in the next year,” and (2) how likely it was that she would “have more children in order to get a bigger welfare check” (reverse-coded) Both items used a four-point response scale, ranging from “very likely” to “not at all likely.”},

- causal mechanism?
- why don't we oberve more constraint then?

Summary:
Individuals might not structure their beliefs along ideological dimensions, but they seem to use values to structure their beliefs.

Method: ANES panel data. He factor analyses (Likert-style) issue items to create factor scores on the values “Equality”, “Individualism” and “Free Enterprise”. He then regresses all kind of political position issues, performance evaluations (on political issues) and candidate evaluations on the factor scores of the values, controlling for Party ID and Ideology. Ultimately, he shows that the values of equality and individualism can very well (better than Pi and ideology) predict issue positions and evaluations, indicating that individuals might structure their political beliefs and assessments along those values.},

- political ideology has to be specified in a multi (2) dimensional context: economic and social ideology 
- people have different understandings of liberal/conservative 
-> heterogeneity in the meaning that citizens can impose on the left-right continuum 
- modeling the predictors of ideology yields substantially different conclusions in a two-dimensional model than the one-dimensional model: demographic/psychological variables 
- interesting: correlation b/w dimensions increases as knowledge increases 
=> "multidimensionality leads to a significant amount of heterogeneity in the structure of ideology that must be modeled to fully understand the structure and determinants of political attitudes"

summary:
- Liberalism and conservatism are not defined homogenously within the public and for the majority of people, ideological identification is defined solely in terms of one dimension or the other. Instead of people along a spectrum, there are difference classes of ideologues. 

Need for closure associated with social conservatism and insignificantly associated with economic liberalism. 
Class 1 – Liberal issue position consistently – .58 identify as liberal, .3 conservative
Class 2 – liberal on economic issues, very conservative on social issues - .24 liberal identify, .43 conservative
Class 3 – moderate on econ, very liberal on social issues – most likely to identify as liberal - .73 liberal identify
Class 4 – moderate on econ, very conservative on social – very likely to identify as conservative .73 identify
Class 5 – relatively liberal on social, conservative on econ – libertarian – identify as conservative - .7
Class 6 – consistently conservative - .96 identify as conservative
-> Class 1 and Class 6 are the standard liberals and conservative and make up only 40 percent of the sample. 

- Three latent class measures – one class – link ideology to both dimensions (45 percent of the sample)
- Other two link it to only one of the dimensions. 
- Religiosity, authoritarianism and egalitarianism all linked to ideology in class 1, in the other two classes – egal only linked in economic class, other two only linked in social class.},

-> citizens use values when discussing their policy preferences

Summary:
Support or opposition for social welfare draws upon two values which are in competition for liberals, less so for conservatives: individualism vs. equality. Conservatives put more emphasis on individualism (although they not completely ignore equality [of opportunity, not equality of outcome]) while for liberals, both are important (hence, they are ambivalent on social welfare). Liberals have to reconcile this value conflict, while conservatives can straight forwardly justify their opposition to welfare by appealing to individualism. Liberals, who want to justify support for welfare can, on the other hand, not appeal so easily to egalitarianism as there is less acceptance for this in a society that is dominated by individualism. Thus, they have to fall back and justify their position by pragmatic and concrete arguments for single policy measures, rather than by invoking general values.

Method: 
ANES data. They use again the probes as they did in the other Zaller/Feldman 1992 article and they analyze the content of the considerations the participants had indicated concerning welfare spending issues. They show that i) individuals indeed make frequently reference to values and they once again confirm Stanley’s 1988 paper: “The values they invoke are not partisan values of liberalism and conservatism but the common cultural values of America’s liberal tradition”; ii) social welfare liberals who support social welfare justify their answer by reference to particular programs, while social welfare liberal who oppose social welfare similarly as social conservatives justify their answer by appealing to individualism as a value; iii) social conservatives are less ambivalent in their considerations and most considerations refer to individualism while social liberals who support welfare programs express more ambivalent considerations; iv) political information seems to have no influence on whether someone invokes values or not. [but does this not contradicts other findings of them?]},

- resut: parasite stress -> stronger family ties and higher religiosity
- hypotheses supported even when controlling for potentially confounding factors such as wealth etc.

theoretical background: parasite-stress theory of sociality
- argues that philopatry, xenophobia and ethnocentric values and related personaliry features and behaviors are affected by disease stress -> adaptation (genetic as well as cultural)

- what about individual-level differences in the same environment?
- isn't this a chicken-or-egg problem? segregated communities lead to geographically localized coevolution/immunity of parsite and host

Using panel data collected on a national sample in West Germany between 1987 and 1989, we show that variables from a ``collective interest{''} model measured in 1987-individuals' dissatisfaction with the provision of collective goods, beliefs that group actions can be successful, and beliefs in the importance of their own participation-predict subsequent participation in collective protest activities. Variables corresponding to the private ``selective incentives{''} associated with protest are found to be less relevant. Furthermore, we find that engaging in protest changes many of the perceptions that influence future participation. We discuss the implications for theories of political mobilization.},

Main Arguments: 
- American Electorate is not as polarized as people claim. On issues the general public generally expresses moderate preferences.
- Polarization has been confused in the literature. People don't distinguish between a closely divided public and a deeply divided public (degree of polarization not taken into account)
- Political activists are not normal people. Activists might be more polarized than the general public.
- Media reporting might be changing perceptions of polarization. Media is biased towards highlighting conflict. This may make people perceive sharper cleavages than actually exist, or they may just exagerate cleavages to generate interest.
- Taking a polarized position does not constitute a polarized choice behavior. Canddiates can be extreme but not the public. 
- Polarization among elites does seem to be real (all though it might be just different perspectives, ie two dimensions of issues, shifting focus to more polarized one can increase perceptions of polarization).
- Might be a function of civil service reforms, there are less material benefits, so only those with more pure ideological motivations enter the government.
- Government is bigger and touches on more areas, so might highlight some more activists (enviroment etc).
- Government is more open. Gives activists more chances to get involved, which can be perceived as more conflict and polarizaiton.},

The predictions of a variety of models drawn from Economics, Sociology, Political Science and Game Theory were compared to the experimental results. One predictive concept, the core of the noncooperative game without side payments (equivalent to the majority rule equilibrium) consistently performed best. Significantly, however, even when such an outcome did not exist, the experimental results did not display the degree of unpredictability that some theoretical work would suggest. An important subsidiary finding concerns the difference between experiments conducted under conditions of high stakes versus those conducted under conditions of much lower stakes. The findings in the two conditions differed considerably, thus calling into question the political applicability of numerous social psychological experiments in which subjects had little or no motivation.},

The nearest one can come to an answer is to ask people about why they have voted, but what people say they do is not necessarily the same as their behavior, which cannot be observed on this issue in real voting situations. The existence, or otherwise, of expressive voting is an important question, because the answer provides insights into explaining voter turnout (i.e. to help explain why people vote), as well as whether their vote ever changes as a result of a change in the probability that their vote will decide-the election (i.e. to help explain what people vote).
By conducting an appropriate experiment, however, direct evidence of whether some people vote expressively may be obtained. This paper describes such an experiment, and gives clear evidence for the existence of expressive voting.},

  abstract  = {We report preliminary results from voting experiments designed to test both decision-theoretic and game-theoretic models of strategic voting. The experiments used a qualified majority voting system in which either of two options required a two-thirds majority to win, and thus for all participants to receive a positive payoff. Since the payoffs varied across the electorate, there were opportunities for strategic voting. An individual might choose to vote for the option that would give her a lower payoff, to ensure that the qualified majority was achieved. Voters were provided with samples of payoffs (or opinion polls) to provide a signal of the support for each of the two options. Some of these were provided to everyone publicly, others to individuals privately. The results so far are consistent with the comparative statics of a formal decision-theoretic model of strategic voting which predicts that the public and private information are of equal importance. We reject a full game-theoretic model since voters did not attach greater weight to the public information.},

- political experts and novices differ in their cognitive strategies -> expertise affects how old information is used to understand new information
- experts have extra processing capacity because of their tighter organization (more and stronger links b/w concepts) of shared knowledge (i.e. knowledge shared by experts and novices alike)
-> novices should be more likely to focus on consistent information only while experts have the capacity to focus on and assimilate inconsistent information as well

study design + analyses:
- lab experiment with student sample (N=82), separated into high and low expertise based on prior survey on political involvement (!)
- P's read vignettes about little known country (Mauritius), which is initially described as communist/democratic/neither (knowledge set), then described in more detail with some aspects being more consistent with democratic while others are more indicative of communist country
- main manipulation/comparison: knowledge set (dem/com) X expertise (novice/expert)

main results:
- inferences about the country: novice subjects more consistent with knowledge set, experts more influenced by inconsistencies in description
- recalling of facts: knowledge set biases recall of novices, while experts are less biased/tend towards inconsistent information

questions/comments:
- results could be interpreted as inconsistent with findings from motivated reasoning (higher sophistication -> more MR), but the study conducted here does not really take into account strong attitudes and directional motives
- their theoretical argument about cognitive functions and short term memory is not very convincing...},

Do candidate ballot positions or the results of previous elections affect voter behavior? We conduct several series of experimental, three-candidate elections and use the data to provide answers to these questions. In these elections, we pay subjects conditionally on election outcomes to create electorates with publicly known preferences. A majority (but less than two-thirds) of the voters are split in their preferences between two similar candidates, while a minority (but plurality) favor a third, dissimilar candidate. If all voters voted sincerely, the third candidate - a Condorcet loser - would win the elections. We find that pre-election polls significantly reduce the frequency with which the Condorcet loser wins. Further, the winning candidate is usually the majority candidate who is listed first on the poll and election ballots. The evidence also shows that a shared history enables majority voters to coordinate on one of their favored candidates in sequences of identical elections. With polls, majority-preferred candidates often alternate as election winners.},

We also refer to a theory of voting ï¿½equilibria,ï¿½ which makes sharp predictions concerning individual voter behavior and election outcomes. We find that Condorcet losers occasionally win regardless of the voting rule or presence of polls. Duverger's law (which asserts the predominance of two candidates) appears to hold under plurality rule, but close three-way races often arise under approval voting and Borda rule. Voters appear to poll and vote strategically. In elections, voters usually cast votes that are consistent with some strategic equilibrium. By the end of an election series, most votes are consistent with a single equilibrium, although that equilibrium varies by experimental group and voting rule.},

  abstract  = {Longitudinal or panel surveys offer unique benefits for social science research, but they typically suffer from attrition, which reduces sample size and can result in biased inferences. Previous research tends to focus on the demographic predictors of attrition, conceptualizing attrition propensity as a stable, individual-level characteristic - some individuals (e.g., young, poor, residentially mobile) are more likely to drop out of a study than others. We argue that panel attrition reflects both the characteristics of the individual respondent as well as her survey experience, a factor shaped by the design and implementation features of the study. In this article, we examine and compare the predictors of panel attrition in the 2008-2009 American National Election Study, an online panel, and the 2006-2010 General Social Survey, a face-to-face panel. In both cases, survey experience variables are predictive of panel attrition above and beyond the standard demographic predictors, but the particular measures of relevance differ across the two surveys. The findings inform statistical corrections for panel attrition bias and provide study design insights for future panel data collections.},

- description of granger causaliy test
- basic idea: X causes Y if incorporating the past history of X can improve the prediction based solely on the history of Y
- some assumptions: vars are jointly covariance stationary, no omitted variables
- 2 tests: Haugh-Pierce technique + direct granger method
- potential issues: e.g. first difference filters as "throwing out the baby with the bathwater", missing variables, measurement issues, feedback loops, anticipation of future values by policy makers
- 2 examples (see text)

important aspects:
- multivariate conceptualization should contain lags for all variables (including controls) -> vector autoregression
- "if an insufficient number of lags is chosen, serial correlation can create artificially significant regression coefficients" (333)},

The results are based on data collected in a national random-digit-dial telephone survey (n = 1,510) conducted prior to the 2004 U.S. presidential election. Analyses show that Americans use the control afforded by online information sources to increase their exposure to opinions consistent with their own views without sacrificing contact with other opinions. This observation contradicts the common assumption that reinforcement seeking and challenge avoidance are intrinsically linked aspects of the selective exposure phenomenon. This distinction is important because the consequences of challenge avoidance are significantly more harmful to democratic deliberation than those of reinforcement seeking.},

The article tests this idea using data collected via a web-administered behavior-tracking study with subjects recruited from the readership of 2 partisan online news sites (N = 727). The results demonstrate that opinion-reinforcing information promotes news story exposure while opinion-challenging information makes exposure only marginally less likely. The influence of both factors is modest, but opinion-reinforcing information is a more important predictor. Having decided to view a news story, evidence of an aversion to opinion challenges disappears: There is no evidence that individuals abandon news stories that contain information with which they disagree. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.},

  volume    = {9},
  comment   = {Overview:
- Traditional power calcutions are flawed due to focus on statistical significance
- Authors propose an alternative framework for design calculations (pre and post data collection) that emphasizes the incorporation of external information to derive assumed effect sizes
- Instead of power, they examine type s (sign) and type m (magnitude) error rates
- Reported estimates in the literature are often based on samples that are too small, noisy measures and small true effects. Combined with selection on significance, this leads to frequently exaggerated significant effects that have a high probability of a sign error (even with decent power)
- side note: conditional on nonsignificance, the direction of an estimate gives almost no information on the sign of the true effect
-> significant findings from studies that are underpowered are likely to produce wrong answers in terms of direction and magnitude of the true effect: "There is a common misconception that if you happen to obtain statistical significance with low power, then you have achieved a particularly impressive feat, obtaining scien- tific success under difficult conditions." (p.9)

key summaries of design analyses (copy&paste):
1. The power: the probability that the replication drep is larger (in absolute value) than the critical value that is considered to define "statistical significance" in this analysis.
2. The Type S error rate: the probability that the replicated estimate has the incorrect sign, if it is statistically significantly different from zero.
3. The exaggeration ratio (expected Type M error): the expectation of the absolute value of the estimate divided by the effect size, if statistically significantly different from zero.},

The estimated effect is significantly negative, accounting for between a quarter and a half of the total decline in turnout since the 1950s. I argue that substitution away from other media with more political coverage provides a plausible mechanism linking television to voting. As evidence for this, I show that the entry of television in a market coincided with sharp drops in consumption of newspapers and radio, and in political knowledge as measured by election surveys. I also show that both the information and turnout effects were largest in off-year congressional elections, which receive extensive coverage in newspapers but little or no coverage on television.},

- examine publication bias in AJPS and APSR in the time period from 1995 to 2007
- both journals showed publication biased (significant results are more likely to be published)

- reason publication bias (defined as leading to bias in published parameter estimates):
1) editors / reviewers prefer significant results
2) authors prefer significant result -> file drawer etc.
3) increase sample size if results are almost significant
4) data mining

possible methods to estimate publication bias:
- examine if smaller studies tend to report larger results -> funnel graph
- caliper test: ratio of reported results just above and below the critical value (p < .05)

conclusion:
- both journals have more results above than below the critical value -> publication bias!
- possible consequences of bias: (a) type I error (false positive) more likely, (b) distortion of research practices, (c) discourages projectzs that are unlikely to produce precise estimates
-> preregistration and stronger focus on research design rather than the estimates produced could be helpful},

  comment   = {basic approach:
- field experiment randomizing television and radio advertising in media markets

results:
- tv campaign ads have a large and statistically significant effect on voter preferences
- effects of advertisements dissipate rapidly -> 1/2 weeks

- results suggest that the underlying mechanism is driven by priming rather than on-line processing

Summary:
TV campaign adds have large and significant effect on voter preferences, but the effects decay quickly (in 1-2 weeks effects disappear). They use random assignment during Rick Perry (RP), 2006 campaign. It is both externally valid (real campaign) and has random assignment (campaign allowed to vary assigned air time to different designated media markets), overcoming shortcomings of field and lab experiments. It just happened so hat in January, for 3 weeks, there were no opponent R, no D, just Rick Perry and two independents. The campaign ads focused on valence issues (Stokes 1963) and had no mention of opponent of their platform, overall gave voters reasons to be proud of TX under RP leadership. After surveying participants, researchers ran simple and dynamic models, but found little evidence of time-series dynamics. 

Main result: 
TV campaign adds have large and significant effect on voter preferences, but the effects decay quickly (in 1-2 weeks effects disappear). 

Comments: 
The pattern of findings is consistent with 1) priming hypothesis – ads prime voters to invoke evaluative criteria (Iyengar (1982); Miller (1996), 2) emotional content of ads increases their effects (Brader 2005). The priming hypothesis implies that the effects of advertising decay as the cognitive accessibility of primed considerations fade. It is not consistent with on-line processing (Lodge (1995)). Zaller (1996) would say that RP 2006 campaign ideal situation for detecting media effects: abrupt shift in quantity of advertising, a vacuum in opposing ads, continuous tracking of opinion before, after and during advertising. Research leave open questions: how effectiveness depends on tone of adds, proximity to election day, competitiveness of the race.},

  comment   = {basic argument: 
- relationship between personality and political beliefs varies across domain and social context 
-> Big Five (B5) affect social and economic dimension differently
-> race moderates the relationship between B5 and political beliefs
- political attitudes as characteristic adaptations, determined by dispositional trats (personality) and contextual factors 
- political issues as stimuli, B5 shapes response

gaps in previous literature:
1) doesn't take into account multi-dimensionality of political beliefs
2) contextual moderators

results: 
- hypothesis confirmed, B5 have differential effects on domains, moderated by race 
- interesting: agreeableness has opposing effects for social and economic domain!

summary:
- Personality traits predate political attitudes and are not caused by social and political influences. They are very stable very early in life and have a genetic basis. 
- Political attitudes are characteristic adaptations – middle level units – that are the product of essential dispositional traits and environmental factors. --- political issues and ideological labels are stimuli to which the Big Five traits shape responses.
-> Conscientiousness – more conservative for both
-> Openness – more liberal for both
-> Agreeableness – more liberal for economic, and more conservative for social
-> Emotional Stability – more conservative for economice, more conservative (smaller magnitude) for social
-> Extraversion – very small conservative effect for both. 
- Some of the effects are statistically different for blacks, suggesting that the effect of personality traits changes across contexts. 

questions: 
- stability and heritability as argument for being causally prior. but what about more basic underlying psychological characteristics? -> threat perception etc. 
- no real specific hypothesis with regard to different dimensions (economic and social) -> mostly agnostic about differences, especially with regard to social dimension 
-> does not seem sufficient for a theoretical underpinning of 2-dimensional conceptualization of political beliefs, the results mostly argue in favor of constraint/coherence 
-> what if the dimensions are independent? 
- problem of causal effect of race? -> it would be interesting to look at the underlying causal variables, such as homogeneity of social network etc. 
- only use 50\% of the sample, this might be problematic},

  volume    = {103},
  comment   = {Main Concerns: 
- Don’t have real defnitions for things like “representativeness”
- Heuristics explain too much and too little

Two Obstacles for understanding these cognitive processes:

1. Narrow norms
- Heuristics and Biases research program: K/T start with Bayes Rule and assume 1 correct answer
 -> Logical order should be: problem content, make assumptions, build models for underlying processes
 -> Process models have been proposed (satisficingalgorithms that predict inferences), yet K/T still defend undefined concepts.
- Single Event Probabilities
 -> Probability laws don’t necessarily apply to a single event 
 -> Inappropriate criterion for diagnosing “cognitive illusions”
 -> Conjunction rule shouldn’t be the standard
 -> Context of Linda problem makes it valid not to conform to conjunction rule.
- Content Blind Norms:
 -> K/T don’t address my critique of imposing a statistical principle as a norm without examining content
 -> Content-blind norms ok for math textbooks, not human judgment.
 -> Language issues with Linda problem

2. Vague Heuristics
- Substituting labels (like “representativeness”) for real explanations
 -> You can start with numerical assessments, but must then discuss the properties of what is being measured.
 -> “Representativeness”: no theory of how this relates to content/context .
 -> K/T point to “framing effect”, but do not address judgmental heuristics

Other problems with K/T reply:
- They say I believe all frequency judgments are valid when they are not
- Because of this, they try to show that frequency judgments can fail. I am aware.
 -> However, under certain conditions, the effect of frequency is stronger than any other de-biasing method
 -> Overconfidence vanishes and the Linda “conjunction fallacy” is massively reduced.
- K/T are unclear about whether their “Seven Letter Study”, which shows that frequency still causes the conjunction fallacy, is between subjects or within subjects.

Base Rate Neglect:
- K/T would like you to think there is no evidence that frequency improves this Bayesian reasoning. Some studies say otherwise.

Conclusion:
- To understand human reasoning in complex environments, simple descriptions will not suffice
- We need models that make falsifiable predictions and can reveal the processes that take place with valid and invalid judgments.

=============================================================

“The problem with these heuristics is that at once they explain too little and too much. Too little, because we do not know when these heuristics work and how; too much, because post hoc, one of them can be fitted to almost any experimental result.” 
Both representativeness and anchoring and adjustment could explain base-rate neglect.
Should move to detailed models of cognitive processes instead of post-hoc accounts of alleged errors.
K and T start out with a convenient normative model and move from there. Instead they should start out by looking at the content of the model.
The laws of probabilities do not apply in single-shot instances – takes the frequentist approach to an absurd extreme conclusion. 
The difference between mathematical and natural language is important – the and in logical is not the same as and in natural language (K and T could respond that their theory says that differences in interpretation are important and that they are dealing with how people transfer mathematical language into natural language.

The empirical procedure tests various combinations of four theoretical perspectives: (1) social integration, i.e., the extent and quality to which an individual is integrated into given social contexts, (2) social trust, i.e., the general willingness to cooperate with other individuals, (3) the support of the social system to which the norm belongs, and (4) the perception of the degree of compliance and the quality of a social norm in an individual's context. The best explanation is offered by the model which combines social integration, the support of the social system and the perception of the degree of compliance and quality of the norm. We also examine additional causal paths of indicators of social integration through system support on the individual voting norm. The paper contributes to an improvement on existing literature through its more complex causal modelling and the placing of individual attitudes in context.},

More specifically, for voters lacking these cues, we expect that there will be a bias toward the incumbent candidate or party, which is motivated by the desire to decrease the potential costs of postdecision regrets. Similarly, we expect that these individuals are likely to delay choosing between candidates and may abstain from voting altogether, which is driven by a shortage of justifications on which to base the decision. We develop measures of perceived party differences based on symbolic and operational differences using data from the American National Election Study and find significant support for our hypotheses in the context of presidential elections.},

This article argues that the sophistication-interaction theory does not hold to the degree the consensus claims. Specifically, it challenges the proposition that sophistication promotes the use of domain-specific beliefs and values. Analysis of l984,1986, 1987, 1988, and 1990 NES data yields two compelling findings. First, a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that beliefs about equal opportunity, self-reliance, and limited government in the social welfare domain and about militarism and anticommunism in theforeign policy domain are structured coherently and equivalently in the minds of citizens at different levels of sophistication. Second, structural equation model results demonstrate that political sophistication does not systematically enhance the impact these principles have on policy preferences.},
  comment   = {- strength of relationship b/w abstract principles (e.g. values) and policy reasoning is not conditional on political sophistication

summary:
- “I demonstrate the beliefs about equal opportunity, self-reliance and limited government in the social welfare domain, and about militarism and anticommunism in the foreign policy domain are structured coherently and equivalently in the minds of citizens at different levels of sophistication. Second I show that individuals are, for the most part, equally adept at grounding policy preferences in these principles. Simply put, all citizens hold genuine core belief and values and rely more or less equally on those when taking positions on many specific issues.”
- Interactions between sophistication and values in models of issues are not anywhere near consistently significant. 
- Domain specific theory – within a domain people hold relevant values and use those values.
- Sophistication interaction theory – people can connect values to preferences only when they have a previous store of political knowledge.
- Most of the evidence for the domain specific theory, but some interactions of sophistication are significant.},

Across the last 100 days prior to the seven elections from 1988 to 2012, vote expectation surveys provided more accurate forecasts of election winners and vote shares than four established methods (vote intention polls, prediction markets, quantitative models, and expert judgment). Gains in accuracy were particularly large compared to polls. On average, the error of expectation-based vote-share forecasts was 51 percent lower than the error of polls published the same day. Compared to prediction markets, vote expectation forecasts reduced the error on average by 6 percent. Vote expectation surveys are inexpensive and easy to conduct, and the results are easy to understand. They provide accurate and stable forecasts and thus make it difficult to frame elections as horse races. Vote expectation surveys should be more strongly utilized in the coverage of election campaigns.},

- empirical investigation of Haidt's moral foundation theory 
- four different studies/approaches to measure moral intuitions

function of norms: suppress selfishness
-> individualizing approach/foundations: Harm/care, Fairness/reciprocit
-> binding approach/foundations: Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, and Purity/sanctity

moral foundations hypothesis: 
- liberals: individualizing approach 
- conservatives: use all five foundations more evenly (individualizing + binding)

studies:
1) moral relevance: rate how relevant various concerns were to Ss when making moral judgments -> self-theories about moral judgment
2) moral judgments: concrete evaluation of statements (agree/disagree with certain action etc.) 
3) moral trade-offs: how much money necessary to perform specific immoral action (-> taboo trade-offs) 
4) moral texts: quantitative analysis of sermons from liberal and conservative churches -> mentioning words that belong to specific category

results (for all 4 studies): 
- liberals: greater endorsement and use of Harm/care and Fairness/reciprocity
- conservatives: endorsed and used the 5 foundations more equally

questions / remarks: 
- last study is interesting, maybe it is possible to combine the word list with ANES open-ended questions? -> moral foundations as basis for political evaluation!!! -> sophistication as potential moderator!!!
- how can this theoretical approach be extended to a multi-dimensional ideological context? 
- what about causal directions?

summary:
Morality is about the question: how ought we to live? Morality used to be defined in psychology as being about protecting individuals and was thus limited to issues of justice, rights, welfare. This means that concerns of conservatives and most non-Western cultures fall outside the moral domain. Haidt (2003) respecified definition of a moral judgment: not by its content but by its function: morals regulate selfishness and make social life possible. Two possibilities to control selfishness: i) individualizing approach: protect individual by endowing them with rights and teach them to respect rights of others; ii) binding approach: strengthen groups and institutions and bind individuals into roles and duties to constrain their imperfect natures. This does not correspond to political left-right (communism and libertarianism cuts across those lines), but there are 5 dimensions.

There are 5 moral foundations: harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, purity/sanctity. Moral foundations hypothesis: liberals rely on harm/care and fairness/reciprocity, conservatives rely on all 5.

Method: i) Ask individuals which concerns are important when making moral judgments and factor analyse their answers; ii) ask individuals for trade-offs: How much do I have to pay you to violate a moral? The more important the moral, the higher the price; iii) they analyze sermons from liberal and conservative churches (better than Republican and Democrat’s convention speeches, because they target a broad audience are full with all morals, whereas sermons are targeted to a homogeneous group and do not have to attract/wedge opponents.},

- analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects is prone to bias due to model misspecification
- machine learning (bayesian additive regression trees to overcome misspecification biases as well as relax linearity assumptions

problems with standard estimation of conditional average treatment effects (e.g. with interactions):
- problematic if number of covariates is large
- multiple testing problem -> deflate p-values
- discretion over division into subgroups potentially problematic

overview of BART:
- builds on regression and classification tree models
- splits the sample into more and more homogenous subgroups
- fitted values are calculated for terminal nodes based on the mean outcome of the respective observations
- generate a large number of trees and combine their predictions

estimation of CATEs:
- generated via simulation
- generate posterior draws for treatment =0 or =1 and setting one of the covariates at a specific value for all individuals
- q: how does this really get to the CATE? what are the underlying assumptions? is it really clear where the interactions are coming from?

advanteages of BART:
- automatic detection of non-linear relationships and interactions
- less sensitive to choice of tuning parameters

empirical example:
- GSS survey experiment: question about "welfare" or "assistance to the poor"

problems / questions:
- is automaticity necessarily better? effect of tuning parameters unclear? discretion with regards to tuning parameters?},

These causal effects are identified at the point of discontinuity that distinguishes those observations that do or do not receive the treatment. One challenge in applying RD in practice is that data may be sparse in the immediate vicinity of the discontinuity. Expanding the analysis to observations outside this immediate vicinity may improve the statistical precision with which treatment effects are estimated, but including more distant observations also increases the risk of bias. Model specification is another source of uncertainty; as the bandwidth around the cutoff point expands, linear approximations may break down, requiring more flexible functional forms. Using data from a large randomized experiment conducted by Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008), this study attempts to recover an experimental benchmark using RD and assesses the uncertainty introduced by various aspects of model and bandwidth selection. More generally, we demonstrate how experimental benchmarks can be used to gauge and improve the reliability of RD analyses.},

-> differences can exist, mechanism is not random, q: how are they distributed?

2) social characteristics are more important
-> social and psychological characteristics are not mutually exclusive; social -> psychological -> behavior, don't control for mediators, developmental schemes

3) individual has low impact -> action dispensability
-> more social than psychological issue
- conditions where individual has an impact: restructuring, unstable environment; location of actor, strategically placed; personal strengths, skills to shape environment (-> tautological?)

4) situation is more important -> actor dispensability
- conditions where personality matters: ambiguous situations, ... (see text for more details)

5) specific aspects of psychology, e.g., ego-defensive needs, specific kinds of psychological variations, factors that make ego-defensiveness more likely: environment, predisposition, types of response

- Take Home: (pg. 32) This review justifies a recommendation to use IAT and selfreport measures jointly as predictors of behavior. Even though the relative predictive validities of the two types of measure varied considerably across domains, each type generally provided a gain in predictive validity relative to using the other alone. The review found that, for socially sensitive topics, the predictive validity of self-report measures was remarkably low and the incremental validity of IAT measures was relatively high. In the studies examined in this review, high social sensitivity of topics was most characteristic of studies of racial and other intergroup behavior. In those topic domains, the predictive validity of IAT measures significantly exceeded the predictive validity of self-report measures.”},

A large fraction of jurors vote to convict even when their private information indicates the defendant is more likely to be innocent than guilty. This is roughly consistent with the game theoretic predictions of Feddersen and Pesendorfer (FP) [1998]. While individual behavior is explained well by the game theoretic model, at the level of the jury decision, there are numerous discrepancies. In particular, contrary to the FP prediction, we nd that in our experiments juries convict fewer innocent defendants under unanimity rule than under majority rule.},

We analyse determinants of non-voting both on the individual and the societal level employing a multilevel design. On the micro level, the sociological determinants under consideration are education, cohort and gender. Regarding psychological or motivational factors, we include in the analyses political efficacy, political interest, political trust and satisfaction with politics. On the macro level, we analyse characteristics of the electoral system, including opportunities for `direct democracy', maturity of democracy, disproportionality factor, and if the participation in elections is compulsory. The data source of the analyses is the European Social Survey 2006. A first main finding is the fact that the probability of non-voting is higher among people with a low level of education and among younger cohorts. The motivational factors have similar impacts on non-voting across all analysed societies. Lack of political efficacy, lack of political interest, lack of political trust and dissatisfaction with politicians and the political system increase the probability of non-voting. Regarding macro influences, countries with compulsory voting and `old democracies' turn out to have a lower rate of non-voting, although these effects vanish when simultaneously modelled with the social psychological micro level indicators.},

- moral reasoning is mostly a form of rationalization of moral intuitions (and affective responses)
-> moral reasoning is also a way to rationalize political attitudes

social underpinnings of moral reasoning
- morality is not about truth, it's about justification towards others (seeking their support)
-> reputation is more important than truth
- evolutionary benefit of morality is to enable cooperation without kinship as well as accountability (see p. 84ff)
- morality as means to justify behavior etc. in front of others.: guard reputation, convince others to support etc.
- moral reasoning -> reputation -> accountability -> cooperation

IMPORTANT:
- check Tetlock: exploratory vs,. confirmatory thought
- conscious reasonong is carried out for the purpose of persuasion rather than discovery!!! -> motivated reasoning
-> moral reasoning as 'extreme' form of motivated reasoning

inconsistenty in Haidt's argument:
- Haidt argues that conscious reasoning is for persuasion, but at the same tiem says that persuasion via rational reasoning rarely works

argument about evolutionary benefit of morality
- p. 105: look at system as a whole -> adaptive etc.
-> one motivated reasoner doesn't find truth, but a group of them will!},

- morality goes beyond justice, rights and welfare (c.f. Turiel's definition) -> no distinction b/w moral and conventional judgments
- 5 central innate intuitions build draft of morality
- virtue theory 
- importance of narritivity in moral functioning

virtue based approaches: 
- moral education is accompished by shaping emotions and intuitions

-> practice and habit rather than pure knowledge

theories of moral development: 
1) constructivism: children are active participants in their own development; no innate content, only empathy as starting point 
2) connectivism: sociomoral world, learning by developing adequate representations; no innate content 
3) relational models: four innate, open-ended relational structures structure social thought and interaction 
4) massive modularity: mind is composed of modules designed by natural selection -> high innatedness 
5) teeming modularity: less strong than (4), only a smaller number of modules exist -> middle way b/w non-modular and massive modular view

five basic intuitions: 
harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity 
-> these are argued to be innate
-> basic adaptive challenges that appear cross-culturally, represents a innate draft that is edited by experience etc.

editing process: 
1) developing virtues: characteristics of a person that are morally praiseqorthy 
2) learning narratives: narrative mode of cognition; narrative is a major cultural tool for the modification and socialization of the fundamental intuitions

=> "The first draft of the moral mind has diverse moral content that was specified in advance of experience, but this innately given content gets revised and greatly extended during the course of development as children actively construct their moral knowledge within a cultural context that uses narrative to shape and guide the development of specific virtues."

question:
- how does this approach help us to explain differences in political thinking?
- Are these innates important for politics? What about the development of narratives?},

  volume    = {20},
  comment   = {overview:
- reweighting observations instead of matching in order to achieve balance
- keeps the weights as close as possible to the base weights
- focuses on population ATT, but can also be used for other effects
- starting point: propensity score weighting (reduce problem to single dimension)
- entropy balancing directly focuses on covariate balance instead of propensity scores
- NOTE: they include squared terms to adjust for covariate variance!

entropy balancing:
- reweighting scheme that satisfies some presepcified balance conditions
- weights can be passed to any subsequent estimation technique -> reduces model dependence
- can be understood as a generalization of propensity score weighting

3 features of reweighting scheme:
- loss function (penalizes deviation from uniform weights, alternative base weights are also possible)
- balance constraints to equalize moments of covariate distributions -> means and higher moments, can include interactions
- normalization constraint (to make weights sum to 1)

-> entropy balancing searches for a set of weights that satisfies the balance constraints but minimizes loss 
-> minimize the loss function given the constraints

advantages of entropy matching:
1) high degree of covariate balance
2) retains valuable information in preprocessed data by weighting instead of discarding data
3) easy to implement, can be used as pre-processing tool for many models, decreases model-dependence
4) computationally attractive

limitations / potential problems:
1) no weighting solutions exists if the balance constraints are inconsistent
2) no set of positive weights exists to actually satisfy the contraint
3) a solution might exist but there may be extreme adjustments to some weights due to lack of overlap

3 monte carlo studies to demonstrate desireable finite sample properties
- compare different matching and weighting techniques
- entropy balancing outperforms other methods in terms of MSE and bias (except in larger samples)

2 empirical exercises including the LaLonde validation exercise and Ladd/Lenz study on newspaper endorsement effects
- LaLonde -> shows reduction in model dependency etc.
- Ladd/Lenz -> higher balance, lesser model dependency

question:
aggregate balance vs. individual-level matches? -> does that make a difference in expectation?
=> overall a very interesting paper, I should look at the method},

Country of origin determines naturalization success more than any other applicant characteristic, including language skills, integration status, and economic credentials. The average proportion of ``no'' votes is about 40\% higher for applicants from (the former) Yugoslavia and Turkey compared to observably similar applicants from richer northern and western European countries. Statistical and taste-based discrimination contribute to varying naturalization success; the rewards for economic credentials are higher for applicants from disadvantaged origins, and origin-based discrimination is much stronger in more xenophobic municipalities. Moreover, discrimination against specific immigrant groups responds dynamically to changes in the groups' relative size.},

  abstract  = {We propose the use of Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) for social science modeling and inference problems. KRLS borrows from machine learning methods designed to solve regression and classification problems without relying on linearity or additivity assumptions. The method constructs a flexible hypothesis space that uses kernels as radial basis functions and finds the best-fitting surface in this space by minimizing a complexity-penalized least squares problem. We argue that the method is well-suited for social science inquiry because it avoids strong parametric assumptions, yet allows interpretation in ways analogous to generalized linear models while also permitting more complex interpretation to examine nonlinearities, interactions, and heterogeneous effects. We also extend the method in several directions to make it more effective for social inquiry, by (1) deriving estimators for the pointwise marginal effects and their variances, (2) establishing unbiasedness, consistency, and asymptotic normality of the KRLS estimator under fairly general conditions, (3) proposing a simple automated rule for choosing the kernel bandwidth, and (4) providing companion software. We illustrate the use of the method through simulations and empirical examples.},

- individual participation in violent conflict as a social dilemma -> why do people participate?
- explanation at the group level -> solidarity mechanisms
- intergroup prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game takes into account both, intragroup and intergroup levels of conflict
- is participation driven by desire to hurt the out-group or help the in-group? -> intergroup prisoners dilemma-maximizing difference game (IPD-MD)

treatments:
- IPD (only conflict, defection increases welfare) vs. IPD-MD (conflict as well as within-goup cooperation, which maximizes overall welfare)
- communication vs. no communication b/w group members

results:
- IPD-MD and communication increased contributions
- contributions almost exclusively for the within-group pool (in IPD-MD) [COMMENT: but this finding is only descriptive!]
- but: participants were willing to compete in the IPD game, at the expense of overall welfare

question/comment:
- overall, I am not convinced by this paper, the game results are direct consequences of the payoff structure, and I think in actual conflicts, there are many more mechanisms that come into play
- external validity? the question of whether in-group love or out-group hate elicit participations seems to be strongly affected by other factors that are not part of an abstract game without context
- maybe students see all participants (including the ones in the other group) as in-group that tries to extract as much money as possible from the experiementer. why should they have an incentive to harm the others? -> motivation would be indpendent of payoffs (identity etc.)!
- experimental manipulation does not really allow us to answer the question, whether participation is driven by out-group hate or in-group love... -> relative gains vs. absolute gains?},

This over-reporting has consequences for our understanding of voting as well as the behaviors and attitudes associated with voting. Relying on the ï¿½bogus pipelineï¿½ approach, we investigate whether altering the wording of the turnout question can cause respondents to provide more accurate responses. We attempt to reduce over-reporting simply by changing the wording of the vote question by highlighting to the respondent that: (1) we can in fact find out, via public records, whether or not they voted; and (2) we (survey administrators) know some people who say they voted did not. We examine these questions through a survey on US voting-age citizens after the 2010 midterm elections, in which we ask them about voting in those elections. Our evidence shows that the question noting we would check the records improved the accuracy of the reports by reducing the over-reporting of turnout.},

The analysis advances previous simulations from the American two-party system to a multiparty system by applying survey data from the Danish Election Studies. In both multiparty elections, the impact of information has significant consequences for party choice. In 1971, political knowledge seems to be the variable connecting class with party choice, whereas political knowledge seems to be the variable connecting issues with party choice in 2005. The information effects are greater than the effects observed in similar analyses of the American two-party system, thus suggesting a positive relationship between the number of parties and the impact of political knowledge. Finally, the analysis supports the notion that right-leaning parties tend to fare better if political knowledge increases.},

  abstract  = {This article examines the electoral consequences of variation in voter turnout in the United States. Existing scholarship focuses on the claim that high turnout benefits Democrats, but evidence supporting this conjecture is variable and controversial. Previous work, however, does not account for endogeneity between turnout and electoral choice, and thus, causal claims are questionable. Using election day rainfall as an instrumental variable for voter turnout, we are able to estimate the effect of variation in turnout due to across-the-board changes in the utility of voting. We re-examine the Partisan Effects and Two-Effects Hypotheses, provide an empirical test of an Anti-Incumbent Hypothesis, and propose a Volatility Hypothesis, which posits that high turnout produces less predictable electoral outcomes. Using county-level data from the 1948-2000 presidential elections, we find support for each hypothesis. Failing to address the endogeneity problem would lead researchers to incorrectly reject all but the Anti-Incumbent Hypothesis. The effect of variation in turnout on electoral outcomes appears quite meaningful. Although election-specific factors other than turnout have the greatest influence on who wins an election, variation in turnout significantly affects vote shares at the county, national, and Electoral College levels.},

Analyses indicated a moderate preference for congenial over uncongenial information ( d = 0.36). As predicted, this congeniality bias was moderated by variables that affect the strength of participants' defense motivation and accuracy motivation. In support of the importance of defense motivation, the congeniality bias was weaker when participants' attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were supported prior to information selection; when participants' attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were not relevant to their values or not held with conviction; when the available information was low in quality; when participants' closed-mindedness was low; and when their confidence in the attitude, belief, or behavior was high. In support of the importance of accuracy motivation, an uncongeniality bias emerged when uncongenial information was relevant to accomplishing a current goal.

- For adolescents, there is no genetic influence, but a large and growing shared environmental influence that grows as they age, but once they reach young adulthood, the genetic influence rapidly jumps up and stays about constant. 
- Further evidence that this is a result of leaving home, the twins that stayed at home did not exhibit genetic influence, but those who left did. This means that genetics only has an influence when people are away from the strong influence of parental socialization. 
- Evidence that most of the influence of parents on adults is through genetic influences. 

interesting idea: 
- heritability of social learning process rather than social orientations themselves:
-> suggests that it is about underlying mechansims that determine how people develop political orientations over the course of a lifetime.},

- paper looks at the effect of foreign elite opposition to the iraq war on attitudes towards a military intervention
- empirical puzzle: both, democratic as well as republican elites were not opposed to war; BUT: there was still large opposition among independents and democrats in public 
- previous theories assumed that domestic elites shape public opinion, since people pay relatively little attention to politics (c.f. Zaller: polarization effect vs. mainstream effect)

main hypothesis: 
- citizens will "listen" to foreign elites if they are trustworthy (not always opposed to US), coherent with their predispositions, and if domestic elites fail to offer equivalent opinions 
- 2 moderators of foreign opposition effet: political predispostions (pid: ind/dem) and political awareness (general education)

method/result: 
- content analysis of tv news, merged with opinion polls over longer period 
- hypotheses are largely confirmed

questions: 
- the model specification is ridiculous: several 3-way interactions etc. 
- is it problematic that the authors did not take into account temporal developments? might lead to spurious results... 
- what about other issues (domestic, economy etc) -> similar influences possible? what about global warming etc? 
- this should actually be a multilevel model, standard errors for news should be clustered 
- experimental study would be interesting, motivated reasoning as theoretical explanation},

Domestic violence also seems to be associated with political change, whether toward greater democracy or greater autocracy. Is the greater violence of intermediate regimes equivalent to the finding that states in political transition experience more violence? If both level of democracy and political change are relevant, to what extent is civil violence related to each? Based on an analysis of the period 1816-1992, we conclude that intermediate regimes are most prone to civil war, even when they have had time to stabilize from a regime change. In the long run, since intermediate regimes ave less stable than autocracies, which in tom are less stable than democracies, durable democracy is the, most probable end-point of the democratization process. The democratic civil peace is not only more just than the autocratic peace but also more stable.},

Studies use different definitions of civil war and analyze different time periods, so readers cannot easily determine if differences in empirical results are due to those factors or if most empirical results are just not robust. The authors apply a methodology for organized specification tests to check the robustness of empirical results. They isolate causes of variation in empirical results by using the same definition of civil war and analyzing the same time period while systematically exploring the sensitivity of eighty-eight variables used to explain civil war in the literature. Several relationships with the onset of civil wars prove robust: large population and low income levels, low rates of economic growth, recent political instability and inconsistent democratic institutions, small military establishments and rough terrain, and war-prone and undemocratic neighbors. Variables representing ethnic difference in the population are robust only in relation to lower level armed conflict.},

This paper derives a strategic calculus of voting for coalitions that generates testable predictions about the effects of polls on strategic voting in elections involving four or more parties. Incentives of leftist voters to vote for a centrist over a noncentrist party are shown to increase with the difference in expected seats between the prospective right-wing and left-wing coalitions (and vice versa for rightist voters). Centrist votersï¿½ incentives to vote for a center-left vs a center-right party are also shown to depend on the relative strengths of the right-wing and left-wing coalitions. Importantly, the strategic voting incentives studied here do not depend on the presence of electoral thresholds or other features of the electoral system. The predictions are tested with survey data from parliamentary elections in Austria and Germany.},

  volume    = {95},
  comment   = {overview:
- argues against the thesis that the party is in decline - increase in elite polarization + increased polarization among electorate (counts likes and dislikes)
-> Argues that parties have polarized at the elite level. This has made it easier for the public to distinguish between the two. This has increased both the importance and salience of parties to the public. 

main arguments:
- Increasing importance of parties at the elite level in recent years should signal a corresponding increase in the masses
-> Clarification of party positions due to elite polarization along ideological lines has led to resurgence
-> Increase in the number of individuals who are positive toward one party and negative towards the other on both likes/dislikes and feeling therms
- Party salience (measured as total number of likes/dislikes) has increased as well
- Straight party voting has increased as well, with a highpoint in 1996

Conclusion:
- Parties are resurgent in terms of individual affect, salience and ability to correctly place the parties in ideological space
- This is due to the polarization of the parties along ideological lines at the elites level, which is filtering down to the masses through the opinion leaders of the public
- One problem here is that Bartels wants to argue for greater ability of citizens to connect specific ideological preferences to the party platforms, but really he is just demonstrating an increasing connection between party and ideological labels; in a Conover and Feldman (1981) sense, this could simply indicate that the stereotypical partisans and ideologues are now viewed as one and the same. Individuals may still have substantial difficulties in connecting ideology to partisanship. Nonetheless, the importance of parties for individual level political behavior is clear in terms of seeing important differences, whatever thse differences may be

problems: - paper doesn't take into account multilevel structure and temporal development in level variables 
- doesn't differentiate between indifference and ambivalence -> (no likes/dislikes = same high amount of likes/dislikes)
=> could be a good term paper for ARFIMA-MLM

- time-varying hypotheses of hetheringtion
- not ARFIMA but rather (1,0,0) or (0,1,0)...},

  comment   = {overview:
- college education itself does not increase political knowedge / sophistication 
- rather, other factors that determine both, college education and political sophistication are decisive 
- most important factors: cognitive ability, parental characteristics, and pre-adult political engagement 
- data: panel of high school seniors, subsequent waves after college etc.

summary:
- Many studies say that education is a direct cause of political sophistication. This study shows that most of the increase in sophistication associated with education happens before people attend college meaning that education is not a cause of political sophistication but instead correlated with other variables that are actually the cause. The most likely being cognitive ability.
- They show that factually political knowledge pre-college is associated with parents’ political knowledge, grades (proxy for cognitive ability), eventual college, and political engagement.

questions/comments:
- it is possible that college education would have an effect on people who chose NOT to go to college, the empirical design only shows that those who select themselves for college gained the political knowledge/interest im beforehand 
- what do the political knowledge questions actualy measure? random factual knowledge? 
- what about college effects on political action/engagement? -> same selection effects, college itself not as important as pre-college factors -> but: what about participation DURING college time?},

We present the first estimation of time series of polarization using the same method on the most comprehensive data for both the public and the Senate. With statistics of various definitions of polarization, we find little increase in the dispersion of views in the public from 1956 to 2012 but do find an increase in ideological sorting starting around 1980. The two time series bear little resemblance to one another with respect to divergence. Further, while congressional sorting exceeds that in the public today, we find that Congress has always been unrepresentative of the public. These results suggest that it is unlikely that changes in public preferences alone explain the widening gulf between the two parties in Congress.},

  volume    = {47},
  comment   = {overview:
- campaigns matter, looking at the conditions under which campaign information could have some effect on a person's behavior
- analyses of campaign effects needs panel data
- repeated measures survey design during 2000 presidential campaign
- Gore support increased after convention, Bush support increased after debates
- responsiveness to campaign events is greates among independents, independent voters, mismatched partisans
- campaign effects are conditional on previous preferences (e.g. attitudes towards Clinton)
- transition model
-> mismatched partisans, undecided voters, and independents are most likely to respond to campaign effects. Partisans aren’t responsive

Result summary:
Table 4 (p.591) shows that estimates of the transition models for the convention and debate periods. Generally, Clinton unfavorability is statistically significant regardless of convention and debate periods. But these are the logit models, so it is difficult to interpret directly. 
But in table 5 (p 592), the table shows the effects of the partisanship and political interest on the predicted probability of transitioning. Based on these results, Gore won the conventions and Bush won the debates. Also voters are less likely to change their vote preference as Election Day nears.
Also, regarding a negative Clinton effect, in the figure 3 (p 593), the more a respondent disliked Clinton, the less likely he was to support gore regardless of previous candidate preference. The Clinton unfavorability effect is large enough to make the difference between a gore vote and bush vote for many voters. 

Conclusion:
In this paper, their main question was who change vote preference in response to campaign events. In particular, they identified which individuals were susceptible to changing their votes following conventions and debates.
Their conclusion is that mismatched partisans, undecided voters, and independents were particularly likely to change their vote preference following the campaign events (persuasion effects). Also, they showed that strong partisan has activation effects associated with the campaign events, but politically interested partisans rarely changed.
Finally, Clinton unfavorability led to negative consequences for Gore.},

  number    = {5},
  pages     = {655--664},
  volume    = {36},
  comment   = {basic argument: 
- paper looks at association b/w aspects of agreeableness (politeness and compassion) and political ideology / moral values 
- previous research: conservatism -> high conscientousness, low openness -> explains preference for tradition/stability but not acceptance of inequality 
- but: what about the personality traits determining egalitarianism?

-> uses personality model that divides each of the Big Five (B5) dimensions into 2 aspects

2 possible reasons for the absence of an effect of agreeableness on political beliefs: 
1) agreeableness might contain different elements that have opposing effects (compassion and politeness) 
2) liberalism and conservatism should be measured 2-dim rather than 1-dim (e.g. social and economic) -> looking at moral values!

Study 1 
- hyp: compassion -> liberalism; politeness -> conservatism 
- results consistent with hypothesis -> aspect-level analyses provides clearer distinction of underlying processes

Study 2 
- hyp: compassion -> moral system of egalitariansim; openess/intellect + conscientousness + politeness -> order + traditionalism 
- results consistent with hypothesis 
- moral values (egalitariansim and order) independently predicted political beliefs 
- egalitarian values mediated relationship b/w compassion and liberalism

- traditionalism mediated relationship b/w politeness (and orderliness + openness) and conservatism

=> "Past failure to identify the importance of Agreeableness appears primarily due to the fact that the two aspects of Agreeableness diverge in their associations with political ideology. Although the Compassion aspect of Agreeableness was associated with greater concern for egalitaria sm (associated with liberal political attitudes), the Politeness aspect of Agreeableness was associated with greater concern for order-traditionalism (associated with conservative political attitudes)." p.661

questions: 
- could both possible mechanism actually display the same underlying pattern? overlapping concepts? 
- this paper argues that null finding for agreeableness can be mainly explained by looking at differenent facets, but Gerber et al. 2010 argue that it's the 2-dim conceptualization of ideology... 
- does it make sense to think of moral foundations as a mediating factor between personality and political attitudes? moral foundations could be seen as causally prior to personality traits...},

Summary 1:
- Traditional model of citizen decision-making (SLM) dictates that favorable and unfavorable information have symmetric linear effects on voters’ attitudes. Authors propose revision (ANM) that says that favorable and unfavorable information have asymmetric non-linear effects.
 -> ANM posits that unfavorable information will have greater impact than favorable information, suggesting an advantage to presenting unfavorable information about one’s opponent, rather than presenting favorable information about oneself.
 -> ANM suggests that the first piece of information about a candidate produces greater change in attitudes than all subsequent information.
- Implications on voter turnout
 -> ANM model showed that voter turnout is enhanced by a stronger preference for a citizen’s preferred candidate if at least one candidate is disliked.

Summary 2:
Compare symmetric linear additive model of evaluation to their own model of an asymmetric nonlinear model of evaluation.
The theoretical background for this is the difference in survival value between approach and avoidance behavior and the necessity of both for survival. Acquire food and avoid predators.
Negativity bias and positivity offset 
-In absence of any information, people should be slightly positive toward an object
-People should be especially attentive to the first information they receive about an object
-If the object appears to pose no great or immediate threat, vigilance can taper off, so the impact of each additional piece of information about he object may diminish
-Because of the greater survival value of threat avoidance in comparison to reward acquisition, unfavorable information should have especially powerful impact, more powerful than favorable information.
-Vigilance to additional unfavorable information should not taper off to the same degree as attention to additional favorable information.

The first piece of negative and positive comments had roughly equal effects on evaluation, but the effect of positive comments quickly drops off and the negative comment weight drops off more slowly.},

In this article we develop ramifications of the neuroscientific paradigm of the ï¿½social brainï¿½ and critically assess its utility for political science. We argue that this model has promise in three distinct areas of research: challenging assumptions, clarifying conceptions, and specifying conditions. We then apply this theoretical framework to a specific puzzle in political science that transcends sub-field distinctions: social norm compliance. We argue that utilizing the social brain paradigm allows us to clarify precisely what social norms are at a physical level, challenge the underlying assumptions of current social norm research, and specify precise and testable conditions of compliance and non-compliance behavior. Ultimately we suggest that the social brain specifically and neuroscience generally offer much promise for political scientists, although scholars must be critical and careful in their justification and application of neuroscientific data.},

The exercise leads naturally to a discussion of political institutions and the size of government.

We investigate the relationship between political (dis)trust and electoral behaviour using the 2009 Belgian Election Study. Belgium presents an interesting case because compulsory voting (with an accompanying turnout rate of 90.4 per cent) compels distrusting voters to participate in elections. Nevertheless, distrusting voters are significantly more inclined to cast a blank or invalid vote. Second, distrust is positively associated with a preference for extreme right (Vlaams Belang) and populist (Lijst Dedecker) parties. Third, in party systems where there is no supply of viable challengers (i.e. the French-speaking region of Belgium), the effect of political trust on party preference is limited. We conclude that electoral effects of political distrust are determined by the electoral and party system and the supply of electoral protest.},

For various reasons, most experiments rely on convenience samples of undergraduate university students.

We therefore urge experimental researchers to broaden their pool of participants, despite the obvious practical difficulties this might entail with regard to recruitment and motivation of the participants. We report on an experiment comparing the reactions of student and non-student participants, showing clear and significant differences. A related problem is that differential attrition rates might endanger the effects found in long-term research. We argue that experimental researchers should pay more attention to the characteristics of participants in their experimental design.},

analyses:
- NAES combined with political ad data focusing on non-battleground states
- panel as well as cross-sectional analyses

results:
- weak evidence for mobilization and learning
- strong effects for persuasion
- persuasive effect is partly mediated by changing affect for candidates
- persuasive effect is moderated by citizen attention: those with moderate political awareness are most susceptible to persuasion

We employ an experimental approach that addresses these problems at multiple levels of observation in a highly dynamic context – small groups of individuals communicating with one another in real time. The analysis shows that participants formulate candidate judgments that decay in time, but the decay occurs at a significantly lower rate among the better informed. Moreover, the better informed are less affected by socially communicated messages regarding the candidates. Hence the influence of experts is not only due to their powers of persuasion, but also to the durability of their own privately formulated opinions. Their role in the communication process is further heightened by the higher value placed by participants on expert opinion, which in turn exposes the recipient to a heterogeneous and hence potentially influential stream of information.},

- chapter discusses the conditions under which group identities become politicized, the underlying psychological process, and the consequences of political identities for political cohesion (-> emotion!)
-> political effects of group membership, especially political attitudes and electoral behavior, as well as in-group solidarity (focuses less on out-group antipathy)

theories explaining development of group-based political cohesion (-> shared political attitudes etc.):
1) cognitive approach: categorization and group salience
2) realistic interest approaches
3) symbolic approaches: social identity theory
4) social constructivism and and the meaning of group membership
5) evolutionary perspective

central factors to the development of political cohesion:
- existence of strong identities, convergent identities, political meaning of group membership, existence of symbolic and realistic threats and grievances, group consciousness

role of emotions for group-based action:
- stronger emotional reactions among strong identifiers etc
- strong group -> anger, weak group -> anxiety
- anger increases commitment to action, anxiety decreases it

development of group identity:
- salient identity, meaning and valence of identity, acquired vs. ascribed identities, permeable group boundaries, group size, individual differences, threat

question comments:
- politial cohesion highest among strong identifiers... but what do we explain by that? what is the causal mechanism? or is it just a different side of the same coin?
- how can group identity be defined without directly including its consequences in the descriptive characteristics},

  comment   = {overview (partly c-p):
- new-racism questions (including symbolic racism/racial resentment) are ambiguous since response patterns could also explained by ideology (e.g. individualism)
- overt racism has been prematurely dismissed as a politically relevant measure -> explanations for racial differences as feasible measure
- negative stereotypes as alternative measure of negative racial attitudes -> linked to overt racism
- denial of discrimination is only an ambiguous measure of racial prejudice
- but: social desireability affects overt measures, self-monitoring scales + randomized-response techniques/list experiments allow to assess the impact of social desireability pressures
- implicit measures of racism (priming paradigm/IAT) are probematic: varying link b/w implicit and explicit attitudes, conflicting evidence on consequences of implicit/explicit attitudes, instability/susceptibility to context
- experiments combined with overt measures as good alternative to assess racial prejudice and political consequences
- The balance of current research evidence indicates that overt racial appeals have less political power than those that remain implicit

FUTURE ISSUES (c-p):
1. More research is needed on the measurement, pervasiveness, and political consequences of overt racism.
2. New approaches to the measurement of racial stereotypes hold some promise in providing alternative measures of prejudice and the assessment of its political effects.
3. It remains unclear why many whites deny the continued existence of discrimination in American society. It is also critical to distinguish in future research between the origins and consequences of the denial of discrimination. Even if denial of discrimination has different origins for different individuals, it may have the same political consequences by reducing support for government actions to remedy racial inequities.
4. Political scientists should consider the incorporation of implicit racial attitudes in their research, though with caution, given continuing disputes in psychology over their meaning and nature.
5. There is a need for greater cross-fertilization between political scientists and social psychologists in the measurement and assessment of racial prejudice. Political scientists need to examine implicit attitudes more closely to gauge their utility to political research; psychologists should examine the effects of implicit racial attitudes on candidate choice, effects of political campaign ads, and so on.},

  comment   = {- anxiety and percieved threat have distinct effects
- anxiety increases risk aversion
- perceived threat increases desire for retaliation

- Overview: Applying the emotions work from Marcus and Brader, looks at the effect of anxiety after 9/11 on American policy. 
- People who experienced high levels of anxiety after 9/11 were less supportive of aggressive military action, President Bush, and wanted the U.S. to increase isolationism. They also had less knowledge of the ongoing events, even though more anxious people were more likely to seek out information (ie, watch the news). Also, increased depression about 9/11. Anxiety was not significantly related to immigration restrictions, support for domestic anti-terror policies, or Arab stereotyping.
- In contrast, people who experienced high levels of threat (but were not overly anxious) supported Bush and antiterrorism policies, supported more restrictive immigration, showed greater stereotyping of Arabs, and a greater concern over the failure to enact domestic anti-terrorism policies than they were concerned about resulting challenges to civil liberties. 
- In general, anxiety leads to overestimations of risk but threat leads to retaliatory attitudes. 
- Criticism: No mention of anger in the study.
- Links to other literature: Their findings relate to Marcus and MacKuen, in that they find anxious people did engage in more information seeking behavior, but this did not cause them to actual have better information (as the authors point out, anxiety puts stress on cognitive faculties).

===================================================================

overview:
- Different effects of threat and anxiety on support for anti- terrorism policies 
 -> Inhibited learning of the world, depression and lower support for government action due to anxiety (in conflict with Valentino 2008?)
- Potential explanations:
 -> External threat certainty about source of blame anger?
 -> External threat uncertainty about the source of blame anxiety?
 -> How to explain the different emotional reactions?
 -> How to embed these results in the Appraisal Framework which suggests varying effects for fear and anger? Threat more of a stimuli rather than an emotion?},

The authors found that participants in their longitudinal,, qualitative study expressed extreme dissatisfaction with politics, politicians, and the outcomes of a young democracy yet voiced enthusiasm for voting. Checks after the ballot revealed they actually did vote. In this article, the authors argue that this unlikely constellation is explained by participants' emotional appraisals Of Mediated campaign messages about a polarizing presidential candidate. Grounded in an individual's class position, emotional appraisal of this candidate generated fear in wealthy participants and hope in poorer participants. The coping mechanism, or ``secondary assessment{''} of the candidate, was the firm decision to vote. Based oil these findings, the authors propose a model of disenchanted voting that integrates research on emotional appraisal and the social construction of emotions with election salience and personal political efficacy. These findings may be Of use in economically polarized democracies beyond Mexico. However, the authors question whether long-term polarizing political discourse is a viable antidote to disenchantment with the uneven economic and social justice outcomes of Latin American democracy.},

1) Start with N nodes (concepts) and position them on a latent graph Z_i
2) On the latent graph Z_i, add edges (links) between pairs of nodes (links) at random. The edge (link) between concept j and concept k is included with probability theta_jk.
3) Finally, the latent graph Z_i is ï¿½prunedï¿½ (defined in Equation [3] later) to arrive at the observed map Y_i. That is, any concepts in Z_i not connected in some way to the core concept are removed to obtain Y_i.

-> what about individual heterogeneity?

  number    = {04},
  pages     = {1099--1120},
  volume    = {81},
  comment   = {overview:
- foreign-policy attitudes might not be structured along ideological dimensions, but they are still organized, namely by general postures (militarism, anti-communism, isolationism), which are themselves constraint by core values (morality of warfare, ethnocentrism [that your nation is superior to others]). 
- They draw upon schema theory (Hamill, Lodge, Blake 1985) to argue that individuals are cognitive misers and organize their attitudes around schemas to reduce cognitive effort. They apply different schemas for different policy domains (rich-poor schema for economic issues, ideology or partisan schema for non-economic issues).

Detailed Summary:
- Foreign policy attitudes are thought to be unstructured and disorganized in the mass public. Hurwitz takes an information processing (cognitive miser) approach to these attitudes and suggest that core values influence specific the attitude formation of specific attitudes. In other words, broad core beliefs have a trickledown effect that allows people to make up their minds about particular issues. 
- Authors look at the issue of foreign affairs because there is evidence that the mass public think the least about it and thus have less structured attitudes (so it’s a hard case to prove).
- Authors say that one’s core beliefs about the morality of warfare and ethnocentrism trickle down to issues like defense spending and nuclear arms policy (why he chooses these core values, we don’t know). Attitudes towards anticommunism and isolationism are mediators between the core beliefs and specific policy preferences. So what Hurwitz is saying, is that when people have little information about specific policies, they look to see whether it is congruent with their overarching core values. 
- Authors differentiate between ‘core values’, ‘postures’ and ‘issues’ ( with core values influencing postures, which in turn influence issues; respective examples being: ethnocentrism, morality of warfare; militarism, isolationism, anti-communism; defense spending, international trade, etc.)
- Criticism: The distinction between ‘postures’ and ‘core values’ seems fairly weak.
- Findings: Even though there’s a lack of information in the public about international issues, that doesn’t mean there’s no consistency/structure. Because people are cognitive misers, the lack of information motivates people to look to their core values, and thus develop these consistent structures.},

We demonstrate that a well-known class of statistical models, called finite mixture models, provides an effective way of rival theory testing. In the proposed framework, each observation is assumed to be generated either from a statistical model implied by one of the competing theories or more generally from a weighted combination of multiple statistical models under consideration. Researchers can then estimate the probability that a specific observation is consistent with each rival theory. By modeling this probability with covariates, one can also explore the conditions under which a particular theory applies.We discuss a principled way to identify a list of observations that are statistically significantly consistent with each theory and propose measures of the overall performance of each competing theory. We illustrate the relative advantages of our method over existing methods through empirical and simulation studies.},

According to the anticipated agreement hypothesis, people prefer to hear about candidates with whom they expect to agree. The issue public hypothesis posits that voters choose to encounter information on issues they consider most important personally. We tested both hypotheses by distributing a multimedia CD offering extensive information about George W. Bush and Al Gore to a representative sample of registered voters with personal computers and home Internet connections during the closing weeks of the 2000 campaign. Exposure to information was measured by tracking individuals' use of the CD. The evidence provided strong support for the issue public hypothesis and partial support for the anticipated agreement hypothesis. Republicans and conservatives preferred to access information about George Bush, but Democrats and liberals did not prefer information about Vice President Gore. No interactions appeared between these two forms of selective exposure.},

avoiding artificial effects:
- use (manipulated) 
- ask people not to view other news in the sequential experiment

- items of interest part of lengthy questionnaire

adressing external validity of experiment:
- minimize artificial nature, make it as unobtrusive as possible
- they don't rely on student sample
- multiple comparisons, measure the concepts in several ways

  comment   = {- Innovation: If you’re going to look at the effect of TV ads on attitudes you have to look at it over time, and approximate, as much as possible, a naturalistic setting. Previous theory had shown that the media tells us what issues are important, but they had been in less realistic lab settings and hadn’t looked at change over time
- TV news programs profoundly influence what viewers see as important. What they found was that whatever the media decides is important (i.e, prominently featured) viewers tend to perceive as more important. This spills over into presidential approval, so if economic concerns are prominently featured people tend to evaluate the prez upon economic aspects. 

Studies (2 experiments):
- Respondents came into the lab six consecutive days. 
- DVs: ratings of the President (Carter) and ranking of importance of eight national issues (pre and post experiment)
- Control group watched a regular news broadcast. Treatment group watched a broadcast with stories inserted that talked about a specific issue (eg: defense, pollution, inflation, etc.)

Hypothesis: 
- participants would evaluate Carter more on the issue that was made more salient
- The effect persisted at least 24 hours, which suggests that priming is likely an ongoing process.

-> The agenda setting effect is not mediated by information recall instead it is mediated by the ability to counterargue which is measured by the number of counterarguments people had in response to the news stories. These counterarguers were the politically knowledgable.
-> tv programs influence what is important. What the media covers affects evaluations of the president (Iyengar and Kinder 1989)},

overview:
broad discussion of factors defining social groups, good overview of theoretical discussion of racial prejudice etc.

class struggle:
- conflict and exploitation in society vs consensus
- empirically, there is mostly no open conflict
- but Weber -> status differentiation separated from economic differentiation

racial prejudice:
- potentially non-economic factor -> independent of class
- but: realistic group theory
-> individual/psychological attribute or determined by group interests etc?
- question of measurement

political tolerance
- framework: empirical democratic theory
- democracy requires citzens' consensus of rules of the game etc.

gender relations / gender attitudes research
- discusses similarities to racial prejudice as well as class consciousness literature

conclusion:
- study of race, class, and gender broke apart in disparate networks of development
- but: focal point of each network is conflict and hostility
- "All these lines of research tend to depict intergroup attitudes as primarily the property of individuals and as being purely expressive, rather than as political communications."
- different assumptions about whether group differences can be viewed as rational or irrational

CHAPTER 2:

overview:
- dominant group tries to avoid hostility, it should be interpreted as a sign of weakness/ineffective coercion mechanisms rather than a sign of strength of dominant group
- institutionalization of group-differences and ideology as implicit ways to guard status-quo -> constrain the visions of the subordinates
- ideological consistency is not required, depends on political needs for the group -> we shouldn't expect to find consistent belief systems like Converse argued

But these vote-specific parameters are more important in higher-dimensional settings: prior restrictions on vote parameters help identify the model, and researchers often have prior beliefs about the nature of the dimensions underlying the proposal space. Bayesian methods provide a straightforward and rigorous way for incorporating these prior beliefs into roll call analysis. I demonstrate this by exploiting the close connections among roll call analysis, item-response models, and ï¿½full-informationï¿½ factor analysis. Vote-specific discrimination parameters are equivalent to factor loadings, and as in factor analysis, they (1) enable researchers to discern the substantive content of the recovered dimensions, (2) can be used for assessing dimensionality and model checking, and (3) are an obvious vehicle for introducing and testing researchers' prior beliefs about the dimensions. Bayesian simulation facilitates these uses of discrimination parameters, by simplifying estimation and inference for the massive number of parameters generated by roll call analysis.},

  abstract       = {This paper presents a simple, but theoretically appropriate, model for the influence of party identification on issue attitudes. Most studies simply relate partisanship directly to issues. However, that approach does not explain how one variable affects the other. Here, party identification is modeled as a manifestation of reference group phenomena. As such, a person's issue positions are taken to be a function of perceptions about his or her party's stands on the same issues. In addition, the degree of consistency between partisan perceptions and attitudes should increase with stronger party attachments. The analysis also examines the alternative possibility that a person's beliefs about his or her own party are largely rationalized from the individual's own feelings. The model is tested using data from the 1980 Center for Political Studies (CPS) American National Election Study. The empirical results show that partisanship does provide cues for guiding personal political orientations. At the same time, perceptions of the parties' issue stands are not merely derived from the citizens' own attitudes. Thus, the analysis supports the conventional view of party identification as an example of reference group influence on individual behavior.},

Hypotheses: A cumulative structure underlies liberal-conservative terminology as applied to to various political stimuli. This structure is useful for understanding the distribution of and influences on ideological thinking within the American electorate. 

Methods: Mokken scale analysis of items measuring liberal-conservative consistency in political judgments is followed by regression analysis of individual scale scores. Data for the analysis are taken from the 1984 and 1988 CPS National Election Studies. 

Results: Ideological consistency in political judgments does conform to the hypothesized cumulative structure. The empirical scales obtained from the analysis show: Systematic differences in the ideological content of political stimuli; much temporal stability, along with changes in the structure of ideological thinking; and factors that affect individual placements along the cumulative dimension within each year},
  comment   = {basic findings
- mokken scaling analysis -> cumulative structure underlies liberal-conservative ideology
- similar result as Converse 1964: skewed distribution of political belief constraint /
- Candidate, parties, and issues vary in their ideological difficulty, and this is different than the variation in an individual’s ideological sophistication.
- Different types of ideological activity are harder than others -> from easiest to hardest: Placing candidate/party, Placing self, Consistent vote/PID/cand eval, Easy Issues, Hard issues
- Expected determinants of who can do the harder activities -> self-identifier, education, politica knowledge, involvement and participation.},

- about 20+\% show intransitivities between: liberty, equality, seconomic security, social order
- example of sophistication conceptualized as knowledge + education + income

2 explanations for intransitivity: 
1) ambivalence (should be increased by sophistication) 
2) indifference (should be decreased by sophistication) 
3) malleability of value choices -> strong framing effects 
4) simple measurement error

Results: 
- political knowledge has a negative effect on prob(intransitive) -> supports indifference hypothesis 
- values (differential importance of liberty & equality) affect political issue attitudes (spending for needy etc.) 
- pol know (but not intransitivity) increases variance in issue attitudes

-> "reveals the lack of support in these data for the hypothesized impact of value conflict (whatever its source) on the attitude formation process." 
-> "further confirmation for the importance of political sophistication in facilitating the movement from general value choices to specific political attitudes."

Question: 
- how can the value structure be separated from political ideology?
- does intransitivity necessarily mean that values are weighted equally?},

Several limitations in the existing literature regarding the dependent variable, the operationalisation of welfare regimes, how the relationship between regimes and attitudes is identified, and the methods used are proposed as reasons why no link between regimes and attitudes has been found. An alternative approach is developed in which welfare regimes are operationalised using a range of theoretically defining characteristics, e.g. total public social spending, benefit generosity, and the weight of social services relative to total public social expenditure. Using data on 13 Western European countries from the first two waves of the European Social Survey, the empirical analysis provides mixed support for the hypothesized relationship between welfare regimes and support for redistribution. Several suggestions for future research are also discussed.},

-> seeks to regulate society via inhibition (restraints) in the interests of social order

=> fundamental divergences in the conception of groups/group membership:

- conservatives: intergroup boundaries, common social identity 
- liberals: intragroup variability and interdependenct

summary:
- It posits that the difference between conservatism and liberalism is an emphasis on approach and avoidance orientations. Conservatives are avoidance based and liberals are approach based. 
- Liberals are focused on providing for the group with positive benefits while conservatives are focuses on protecting the group from negative outcomes.
- When conservatives call for more limitied government, it is limiting the government as a provider. She says this difference in approach and avoidance explains the differences between the social and economic positions of conservatives and liberals. 
- Social conservatism is restraining behavior and economic conservatism is restraining government from providing.},

Labor is used in the agricultural, resource extraction and conflict sectors, and the groups also buy a capital input to conflict subject to the constraint that capital spending cannot exceed resource earnings. I find that exogenous shocks can have different effects on conflict intensity depending on whether the credit constraint binds. In particular, international policies to ban natural resource exports from conflict zones (e.g. `blood diamonds'), raise agricultural productivity or limit the import of weapons will limit conflict intensity if the credit constraint binds. However, if the credit constraint does not bind, then the first two policies promote conflict, and so could even the third policy. The results therefore suggest some caution in international policymaking. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

- US house: strong two-party system 
- Conf house: no party system
- voting in House more predictable than voting in the Confederate House -> DW NOMINATE scaling 
- voting differences not due to differences in structure of preferences but rather to the existence/non-existence of parties 
- in US house, party had a significant effect on vote choice (independent of personal preferences), in Conf house not. 
- furthermore, MPs who would later be in Conf house were also more predictable while still in US house

Summary:
The U.S. and Confederate Houses were exactly the same during the Civil War except the Confederacy did not have a party system. Because there was no party system, roll-call voting in the Confederacy was less predictable/chaotic. Party leaders serve to preserve and foster a party’s reputation but those in the Confederacy were ideologically lost. Personal preferences and party affiliation are usually attributed to voting decisions. Because the Confederacy did not have a two-party system, personal preferences took precedence and thus voting varies greatly. Message: Parties are significant in guiding our decisions and allow for ideological cohesion among many different individuals.},

-> MZ twins as controls, they should be equivalent on many unobserved factors

-> in cases were random assignment is not possible, one could look at twins as possible counterfactuals...
-> ise twins as controls rather than estimating ertitability effects

We first nest the competing models in an encompassing framework and then test the models under alternative representations of party location, where these alternatives lie at the heart of the debate. Fixing party locations at sample means favors directional outcomes, while allowing them to vary over individuals favors proximity outcomes. We treat these as bounds for the model and find that even when the setup favors directional results, the proximity model dominates. This leaves us with a puzzle in that Canadian parties adopt locations that cannot be accounted for by either model.},

3 phases of electoral campaign 
1) emphasis on economy -> Gore ahead
2) candidate's personal characteristics / traits -> Bush ahead
3) issues -> tie
-> phases are suggestive of random walk and online processing

fundamentals:
- social structure, party identification, ideology
-> campaign widened cleavages among traditionally partisan groups (for some groups over certain intervals) -> only a few!!!

ads and news:
- ad gap for bush was a critical factor
- news also had influence, moderated by interest

economy:
- impact of economy did not increase over campaign -> interesting in relation to Gelman/King argument
- forst phase -> economy mattered

candidate traits
- campaign persuaded large body of citizens to alter their perception about Gore (honesty!)
- dynamically, shifts in trait perceptions were the most important single story of the campaign
- irreversible shift in honesty perception of gore is supportive of online processing view

issues
- Gore staged a recovery at the end, in large part due to focus on social security
- events and initiatives of the late campaign clarified the stakes of the election
- debates as critical events to clarify differences between candidates
- little persuasion contrary to predisposition -> polarization on a fundamental

=> bush won the electoral college because he won the ads war, Gore won the popular vote because he won the news war (in the end)

=> campaign mattered, outcome was close because campaign made it so!

question:
- importance of fundamentals in the beginning of the campaign -> consistent with Gelman/King?:
- plausible counterfactuals about campaign effects related to economy contradict the Gelman/King Argument?
- what about positive and negative ads?},

However, in all of these experiments participants were given an overview of all available pieces of information, selected them simultaneously, and did not process the requested information during the selection phase. In the present research the authors show that an even stronger preference for supporting information arises if information is presented and processed sequentially instead of simultaneously (Experiment 1), and they demonstrate that this stronger confirmation bias is due to sequential presentation and not to sequential processing of information (Experiment 2). The authors provide evidence that the increase in confirmation bias under sequential presentation is caused by heightened commitment due to the participants' increased focusing on their decision (Experiments 3 and 4).

  comment   = {overview:
- motivated social cognition argument
- Meta-analyis of political conservatism as motivated social cognition, integration of theories of personality, epistemic and existential needs and ideological rationalization.
- 2 major limitations of traditional research on the psychology of conservatism:
 - too many measures of individual diﬀerences conﬂated psychological and political variables
 - treating political conservatism as an individual-diﬀerence variable neglects relevance of situational factors
- Basic idea: treating political conservatism as a special case of motivated social cognition

Deﬁnitions, Assumptions and Theoretical Approach
- Main assumption: conservative ideologies are adopted in part because they satisfy some psychological needs (-> motivational and informational inﬂuences)
- Basic deﬁnition of conservatism:
 - Core aspects: resistance to change & endorsement of inequality (both aspects are conceptually seperable, but they correlate depending on the context)
 - Peripheral aspects: desire for order and stability, adherence to preexisting norms... (-> suspect to historical and cultural change)
- Main goal: integration of theories relating to the psychology of conservatism:
 - Personality and Individual-Diﬀerence Theories of Conservatism (RWA, Intolerance of Ambiguity, ...)
 - Epistemic and Existential Need Theories (need for cognitive closure, terror management theory, ...)
 - Ideological Theories of Individual and Collective Rationalization (social dominance theory, system justiﬁcation theory, ...)

Empirical Analyses: 
- Meta-analysis of previous studies involving 88 samples from 12 diﬀerent countries between 1958 and 2002.
- Measurements: RWA, C-Scale (change) & F-Scale, SDO-Scale (inequality)
- Hypotheses: political conservatism is signiﬁcantly associated with (1) mental rigidity and closed-mindedness, including (a) increased dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity, (b) decreased cognitive complexity, (c) decreased openness to experience, (d) uncertainty avoidance, (e) personal needs for order and structure, and (f) need for cognitive closure; (2) lowered self-esteem; (3) fear, anger, and aggression; (4) pessimism, disgust, and contempt; (5) loss prevention; (6) fear of death; (7) threat arising from social and economic deprivation; and (8) threat to the stability of the social system.

Conclusion and Relevance:
- Consistent and strong relatively support for the general hypothesis that a speciﬁc set of social-cognitive motives are signiﬁcantly related to political conservatism.
-> all those variables mentioned above impact conservatism
- Motivated social cognition helps to integrate previous approaches to conservatism. Furthermore, situational factors have to be taken into account.
- Political attitudes and beliefs possess a strong motivational basis.

Summary:
Social and economic conservatism are adopted because they satisfy basic psychological needs: need for order, certainty and security. Conservatives reject social and economic change likewise because change is always risky and bears uncertainty. They integrate personality theories (authoritarianism, dogmatism–intolerance of ambiguity), theories on epistemic and existential needs (for closure, regulatory focus, terror management), and ideological rationalization (social dominance, system justification) in their approach as mediators between threat / uncertainty / insecurity and conservatism as the ultimate outcome. They argue that conservatism – due to those many source variables has situational as well as dispositional roots.},

  comment   = {overview:
- review paper for research using neuroscientific methods, discusses four research areas that political neuroscience contributed to extensively
- advantages of neuroscientific methods to examine questions in political psychology "in terms of technical sophistication and relatively precise, objective measurements that are less subject to social desirability and self-presentational biases, in comparison with research that depends upon methods of self-report," such as fMRI
- but: problem of reverse inference, activation of brain region does not necessarily imply specific psychological phenomenon (like fear, arousal etc.)
-> there are "limits to what can be inferred about the mental states and processes of individual actors solely on the basis of brain activity and anatomical structure"

four areas of empirical inquiry that account for most of the publicly available research in political neuroscience:
1) racial prejudice and intergroup relations: examining the neural processes involved in racial categorization and prejudice, physiological and other nonverbal manifestations of intergroup biases and its consequences
2) existence of partisan bias and motivated political cognition: examine neurocognitive processes, for example showing that political partisans process the mental states of fellow ideologues differently thatn those who hold divergent opinions
3) nature of left-rigth differences in political orientation: how are ideological differences linked to variability in brain structure and function, the argument here is closely related to Jost's sytem justification theory (resisting/advocating change & accepting/rejecting inequality), for example examining differences in brain activity as a response to conflict monitoring
4) dimensional structure in political attitudes: e.g., different brain regions were activated when participants ruminated about different types of statements, which could be interpreted as evidence for a multidimensional conception of political ideology.

interesting review, check again for:
- self-regulation of prejudice
- partisan bias and motivated political cognition
- processes underlying attitude change
- p.26: interesting argument about how the "universe of political issues and opinions can only be represented faithfully in multidimensional space and yet maintain that actual political actors--for cognitive as well as motivational reasons--might prefer (1) single over multiple dimensions of judgment and (2) contrasting over orthogonal methods of categorization."

questions:
- are areas of brain activity prone to confirmation bias? -> pre-registration of expectations would be great!
- ideology as motivated cognition vs, motivated reasoning as a more general process
- uni-dimensional ideology as a cognitive simplification},

  abstract  = {This article discusses how endogenous mechanisms linking processes of violent conflict and the economic well-being of individuals and households in combat areas provide valuable micro foundations to the ongoing debate on the causes and duration of armed conflict. Notably, the endogenous relationship between conflict processes and household economic status leads to the emergence of symbiotic associations between armed groups and households living in areas they control that affect substantially the probability of a conflict starting and its effectiveness thereafter. Households in conflict areas draw on local armed groups to protect their economic status when anticipating violence and during the conflict, while armed groups make use of different levels of (either reluctant or voluntary) participation, support and cooperation from local populations to advance their strategic objectives at the onset and throughout the conflict. The level of household participation at the start and during the conflict is a function of two interdependent variables, namely household vulnerability to poverty and household vulnerability to violence. The poorer the household is at the start of the conflict, the higher is the probability of the household participating and supporting an armed group. The higher the risk of violence, the higher is the probability of the household participating and supporting armed groups. The interaction between these two variables varies with the conflict itself and is defined by the direct and indirect effects of conflict-induced violence on the economic behaviour and decisions of households in combat areas.},

- discussion of determinantes for the (false) application of heuristics 
- description of prototype heuristic (as a generalization of the representativeness heuristic ?): 
(1) a category is represented by a prototypical exemplar 
(2) a (nonextensional) property of the prototype is then used as a heuristic attribute to evaluate an extensional target attribute of the category. 
- extension neglect, duration neglect 
- I just skimmed the paper, should look back at it again

summary:
Two systems again – system 1 intuitions are only expressed if endorsed by system 2 – or if system 2 is busy – just like dual attitudes model 
Attribute substitution as a framework for heuristic – When asked about an object or attributed of an object, it is answered by substituting an easier and more accessiblie attribute for the asked about attribute.},

  volume    = {103},
  comment   = {A. Claim that Gigerenzer has two main arguments: one conceptual (the term bias is too harsh) and one empirical (biases disappear when probabilities represented as frequencies).
- Conceptual: Subjective probabilities are meaningless in frequentist statistics, so to say that people exhibit bias when in a unique situation is philosophically wrong. -> Also content and context are ignored.
- Empirical: can make biases disappear using frequencies.

B. K&T’s overall impression of G’s criticism: G grossly rnisunderstands and misrepresents the heuristics and biases perspective
- The heuristics and biases approach is not just about biases in judgments of subjective probabilities, as G says.
- Norms are not as narrow as G would suggest. They have used varied normative standards of comparison, including objectively measured values.
- Their approach does take into account context and content, and does account for problem representation contrary to G3 criticism... I mean, just look at framing effects.
- Accuse G of stealing their idea that problems represented in terms of frequencies result in less bias — e.g., their finding on frequencies eliminating the conjunction error.

C. Base-rate neglect: Intuitive predictions and judgments of probability influenced by similarity or representativeness between evidence and outcome
- K&T provide examples of how frequency presentations and random sampling by S does not do away with base—rate entirely, so to say it disappears is “premature”
- Outcome-ranking paradigm - G ignores these findings 
 -> K&T claim that the outcome—ranking findingscaddress G’s criticism that representativeness and similarity are not satisfactorily de ned
 -> because the results are assessed experimentally, they don’t need to be defined a priori.
- Overall, base—rate neglect can be attenuated when base~rate info is given to S’s; random sampling is not sufficient to eliminate base—rate neglect; results from outcome—ranking not changed

D. Conjunction errors: “Because representativeness and availability are not con—strained by [the conjunction] rule, violations are expected in situations where a conjunction is more representative or more available than one of its components” (p. 585).
- Conceptual (Normative): G argues that the application of frequentist stats to a unique event is meaningless.
 -> K&T say that the general public does this, so it’s not a good argument (e. g., Even if it is meaningless to assign probability of death to a single individual, it is more likely that someone will die within a week or within a year, and that most people would agree).
 -> Violation of conjunction rule can lead to choosing dominated alternative (i.e., betting on Linda being a feminist bank teller rather than a bank teller)
- Descriptive 5 Empirical): Again, according to G this bias disappears with frequencies.
 -> K&T say no, it’s not just frequencies that matter. One of their first demonstrations of the conjunction error was with frequencies (e.g., seven—letter words with n in the 6th place vs. seven—letter words ending in mg)
 -> They couldn’t get S’s to use the inclusion rule by presenting contiguous events, so they hypothesized that presenting frequencies would work (e. g., how many men with heart attacks?).
 -> Error was attenuated. So, they wonder why G attributes this finding to others.
 -> Further, it is not frequencies per se that attenuate the error, but cues that make the correct answer apparent.
 -> Between— vs. within— subjects design —ability to detect the relation of set inclusion is what matters.
- Methodological Issue: The fact that in between-subjects experiments participants approach the problems differently means that answers stem from inconsistent estimates and beliefs.

E. Overconfidence
- G’s normative issue (according to K&T): Can’t consider this a bias because judgments of confidence are meaningless to a frequentist.
-> K&T say that the fact that S’s can’t adequately judge their accuracy has implications for real life —> probability assessments are meaningful (e. g., in medicine).
- G says that bias is seen only because there is not a random sample of general knowledge questions and that if these assessments were made in frequencies, the bias would disappear.
-> But, what represents a random sample of general knowledge questions? And even when there is a random sample, the bias does not disappear.
-> What about the discrepancies between individual and aggregate assessments? -> G says incompatible with K&T’s approach, but K&T say that's not so: Outside vs. inside view},

Laboratory researchers face at least two challenges: determining who to study and how to lure them into the lab. Most experimental studies rely on student samples, yet skeptics often dismiss student samples for lack of external validity. In this article, we propose another convenience sample for laboratory research: campus staff. We report on a randomized experiment to investigate the characteristics of samples drawn from a general local population and from campus staff. We report that campus staff evidence significantly higher response rates, and we find few discernible differences between the two samples. We also investigate the second challenge facing researchers: how to lure subjects into the lab. We use evidence from three focus groups to identify ways of luring this alternative convenience sample into the lab. We analyze the impact of self-interest, social-utility, and neutral appeals on encouraging study participation, and we find that campus staff respond better to a no-nonsense approach compared to a hard-sell that promises potential policy benefits to the community or, and especially, to the self. We conclude that researchers should craft appeals with caution as they capitalize on this heretofore largely untapped reservoir for experimental research: campus employees.},

- group's gender composition interacts with decision rule to increase or decrease gender inequality in voice/authority
- experimental data with many groups, looks at links b/w individual attitudes and speech
- interaction of decision rule and group-gender composition determines female disadvantage in deliberative representation
- under majority rule, increased descriptive representation decreases the female disadvantage
- unanimous rule protects women in minority, but men in minorities become too dominant under unanimity: "Minority women leverage unanimous rule to reach equality, whereas minority men leverage it to exceed equality"

experimental design (same as Mendelberg et al. 2014, APSR):
- group discussion of 5 participants (0-5 women) + unanimous vs. majority rule -> 6 X 2
- goal: set the most just principle of redistribution and set a poverty line (which applied to themselves in the experiment but could hypothetically apply to society as a whole)
- average discussion: 25 minutes
- measures: mean talk time, proportion talk by gender, rating of influence (others + self)

main results:
- women are often disadvantaged in speech participation (men are never disadvantaged)
- "women participate less than their equal share when they are a minority and at equal rates when in a large majority (at least under majority rule)"
- "women tend to do best in homogeneous groups"
- "female tokens participate less than male tokens"
- "women’s inﬂuence gap shrinks as their numbers grow (under majority rule)"

comments:
- asked participants after the experiment who of the group was "most influential" -> I could use the same instructions to incentivize the discussion (?)
- prime example of group discussion experiment that goes beyond looking at aggregate group characteristics
- however, it still does not consider content but only at proportion talk/talk time},

- resenting category members as a prime can affect a subject’s automatic behavior.
- OR priming associations related to the category can affect a subject’s automatic behavior. 
-> Still unclear: whether the social category members prime directly affects the subject’s automatic behavior or whether stereotypic trait activation needs to mediate the two. Past studies haven’t measured all 3 things.

These studies:
Examine whether the prime can affect the automatic behavior directly or if stereotypic trait activation needs to mediate the two. Specifically: Does showing pictures of old people (prime) directly affect how fast they recognize stereotypical “elderly words” like “slow”? (association speed). Also, does showing pictures of old people (prime) make subjects do an unrelated lexical decision task slower (automatic social behavior). Finally: do the “associated traits” like “slow” mediate the prime (elderly) and the automatic social behavior (doing the lexical task slowly). 

Study 1: Examined the routes by which category priming can influence automatic social behavior
- Method: 
 1. Elderly prime condition: Subjects categorize photos as “elderly” or “not elderly”
 2. Control condition: Didn’t do this task -> This is a 2 (prime: elderly vs. control) X 2 (type of word: stereotype vs. non-stereotype) design. The prime was between participants and the word was within participants
 3. All subjects perform a lexical decision task. -> Stereotype/non-stereotype words meant to examine stereotype association; The non-stereotype words, country names, were meant to examine automatic social behavior (doing the task slower)
- Results:
 - Subjects primed with elderly did respond slower to the country names (automatic behavior response)
 - Subjects primed with elderly responded faster to the stereotypic words in comparison to non-stereotypic (association response)
 - Priming predicts automatic social behavior INDEPENDENT of automatic stereotypic word activation. The mediation doesn’t need to take place!
 -> You can just see a photo of an elderly person and automatically behave slower. You don’t need to think about the “slow” stereotypes. 

Study 2: Wants to make sure that using the priming AND lexical decision task didn’t cause fatigue effects, causing the slower response times for the first condition. Instead of stacking the elderly prime against NOTHING, they stack it against a “female” prime. They also want to make sure that the mediation didn’t take place only because they didn’t directly of sufficiently activate the characteristic “slow”. It also looks to see if the elderly prime doesn’t just activate stereotypic words, but also traits simply associated with “slow”. Finally, it looks at whether partialing out the stereotypic traits may be more likely to show mediation. 
- Method: 2 (prime: elderly vs. female) X 2 (type of word: slow vs. dirty) design. Prime was between participants and type of word was within participants. 
 - Priming task: Similar to first study
 - Lexical decision task: 20 country labels, 5 traits related to “slow” (i.e gradual), 5 traits related to “dirty”
- Results: 
 - For behavior effect: subjects in elderly condition responded slower than subjects in female priming condition
 - Subjects in elderly prime condition were faster when responding to slow, rather than “dirty” traits. 
 - Mediational analysis? Priming is still predicting automatic social behavior (doing the lexical task slower) NO RELATION between automatic activation of slow traits and automatic social behavior.},

-Briefcase vs backpack study, c_ _ p _ _ _ tive (cooperative vs competitive) primes
- Pg. 86 These findings lend support to the argument that material objects with a particular social and normative relevance within a given culture—and indeed pictorial representations of such objects—can influence the cognitive accessibility of the broader knowledge structures linked to those representations. Theoretically, then, these same material primes should also lead to predictable effects on social perceptions and behavioral choice—that is, perceptions of social contexts and the demands and constraints presented by the relevant context itself, and behavioral choices made in that context.
- Pg. 93 In particular, we found that prior exposure to business-related pictures and objects led our research participants to generate more competition-relevant word completions, perceive more competitiveness in an ambiguous social interaction, and make more competitive offers in the ‘‘Ultimatum Game.’’ Furthermore, the effects of the primes were moderated by features of the situation, such that primes exerted larger effects in less
structured, more ambiguous situations (Study 5). All of these effects, it is important to note, occurred without participants’ conscious awareness that their responses had been influenced by the primes.
- pg. 93 That is, exposure to material objects may, even without our awareness, help us to define situations, recognize operative situational norms, activate appropriate roles, and interact in ways that are congruent with
those norms and roles (especially among members of the same organization or institution, who are likely to hold highly similar object-meaning associations).

Using a two-step research design, I first estimate an individual-level model of voter choice in 14 parliamentary democracies, allowing voters to hold preferences both for the party most similar to them ideologically and for the party that pulls policy in their direction. While in systems in which power is concentrated the two motivations converge, in consensual systems they diverge: since votes will likely be watered down by bargaining in the parliament, outcome-oriented choice in consensual systems often leads voters to endorse parties whose positions differ from their own views. In the second step, I utilize institutional measures of power diffusion in the parliament to account for the degree to which voters in different polities pursue one motivation versus the other. I demonstrate that the more power diffusion and compromise built into the political system via institutional mechanisms, the more voters compensate for the watering down of their vote by endorsing parties whose positions differ from their own views.},

I use this insight to reinterpret an ongoing debate between proximity and directional theories of voting, showing that voters prefer parties whose positions differ from their own views insofar as these parties pull policy in a desired direction.

Unlike current frameworks of analysis for issue voting, I argue that voters are concerned not only with party positions, but also with policy outcomes. This simple principle carries implications for voter choice under various institutional environments. In consensual parliamentary systems, taking into consideration the bargaining built into policy formation process in the parliament, voters often endorse parties whose positions differ from their own views. In presidential elections, incorporating the compromise between the president and the legislature into their decision making, voters adjust their vote, balancing the two institutions against one another. Finally, in federal systems, voters engage in vertical balancing, utilizing state elections to balance the federal government. I illustrate the latter implication analyzing election returns from Germany between 1965 and 2002.},

- Trust is a reflection of government performance
- social capital also plays a role (civic participation and trusting attitudes)
- Government performance and social capital play a role in trust. However government performance is short term, while social trust has a long term effect on trust in gov't

summary:
This article seeks to find what caused the sharp decline in trust in government from the 1950s to 1970s. Trust in government has typically been thought of as a function of the performance of president, Congress, and the economy. Keele says that it is not these things that facilitate shifts of trust in government, but rather social capital. Social capital is defined as how much the public engages in civic life (thus learning social reciprocity). We trust someone when we feel we can depend on the character and ability of that person. Civic engagement is defined as: participation in community events, participation in political/public affairs, volunteering, and informal socializing. Using a time-series analysis Keele finds that social capital should be a slower and more long-term process reflecting trust in government while performance of president/Congress should be a more flexible,short-term reflection of trust.},

- theoretical paper analyzing the adaptive features of authoritarianism
- authoritarianism establishes and fosters group cohesion and cooperation
- definition of authoritarianism: conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian agression
- basic theoretical arguments: group selection, social learning (based on majority + success), and cultural evolution

1) conventionalism (follow social conventions and traditions):
- development of local norms through cultural evolution
- solves coordination problems etc.

2) authoritarian submission (follow individuals/authorities, who follow the norms):
- group members who follow norms are seen as group leaders

3) authoritarian agression (pubish defection/norm violation):
- enables cooperation in larger groups, reduces costs of individual punishment

authoritarianism and intergroup behavior:
- increases conflicts with out-groups -> bad for out-group
- out-group perceived as threat
- norm violation less severe towards out-groups

interindividual differences:
- result of mutation
- frequency-dependent selection
- changing environment

conclusion:
- authoritarianism has desireable effects (besides the undesireable consequences)

questions/comments:
- adaptive benefits of authoritarianism could potentially be post-hoc arguments
- what can we realy say about interindividual differences based on this approach?},

The study empirically tests the hybrid model by employing real-time tracking of participants' reactions to two candidates in a US presidential primary election debate. The findings confirm an independent, but complementary relationship between on-line and memory-based information processing in an individual's candidate evaluation and vote choice. The co-occurrence of the two modes applies to an individual's comparison of candidates as well. The implications of the hybrid model for the functioning of democracy are discussed.},

  comment   = {CHAPTER 1: Four Theories in Search of Ethnocentrism

overview ethnocentrism:
- definition: ethnocentrism (E) as general predisposition to divide humans into in-groups and out-groups
- contrast to prejudice: E doesn't only concentrate on hostility towards particular group, but rather towards "alien" groups in general, and includes positive dispostitions
- theory must answer three questions: nature, origins, and consequences
-> discusses 4 theoretical approaches

realistic group conflict (Sumner/Sherif):
- ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility due to conflicting interests, incompatible goals, compete for scarce resources
- but: theory cannot explain generalized hostility

authoritarian personality (Adorno/Levinson):
- authoritarian personality as the underlying factor behind ethnocentric ideology -> F-scale
- criticsm: sample bias, scale construction problematic (same direction -> response set)
- Karen Stenner (Authoritarian Dynamic) asks respondents for values that children should be encouraged to learn at home to measure authoritarianism
 
social identity theory (Tajfel/Brewer):
- minimal group experiment -> explicit/objective conflict is not necessary, trivial affiliation is sufficient
- SIT: individuals always try to maintain/enhance self-esteem
- identity defined in large part by membership in social group -> social categorization
- in-group favoritism vs. out-group hostility
- individual differences?

natural selection (Wilson):
- ethnocentrism as adaptation / part of human nature
- natural selection acting on groups -> explanation for altruism etc.
- question: do individual differences in ethnocentrism have a genetic source?

CHAPTER 3: American Ethnocentrism Today

measures of ethnocentrism: 
1) stereotyping: good or bad attributes connected to different (ethnic) groups
2) sentiment: feeling-thermometer towards groups
-> what about social desireability?
-> connection b/w stereotyping and motivated reasoning! c.f. the role of affect!

3 empirical questions for contemporary american context:
1) is in-group favoritism ubiquitous? 
-> quite consistent but not universal
-> stronger among whites and Asian Americans, partial among black and Hispanic Americans
2) is animosity towards out-group generalized?
-> yes, there is consistency within out-groups (in terms of different attitudes) as well as consistency between out-groups (in terms of negative affect etc.)
3) are in-group favoritism and out-group animosity tightly bound to one another?
-> no, in-group and out-group attitudes are not correlated

relationship b/w ethncentrism and standard political predispositions
- general finding: ethnocentrism is widely shared but not very extreme -> subtle superiority
- partisanship (uncorrelated), limited government (uncorrelated), egalitariansim (negative corr), ideology (conservatives higher), social trust (negative corr)
-> ethnocentrism represents a distinctive/independent outlook on social life

individual differences in ethno-centrism:
- instruction and genetic endowment by parents: correspondence b/w parent and offspring ethnocentrism -> genetic transmission rather than social learning
- emergence of personality: authoritarianism affects ethnocentrism
- values and skills impaired by higher education: education decreases ethnocentrism, especially college experience
- ethnocentrism relatively stable over time/adulthood, but decreased during the time of 9/11},

  comment   = {Advocates representing a range of political persuasions helped to fashion work and idleness into popular weapons in the arsenal of rhetoric incentives. Individualism has essentially no role in explaining American’s views on issues of race. (Bobo ’91; Feldman ’88; Kinder and Sanders ’96; Sears ‘88; Snidermen and Piazza ’93). Sniderman and Hagen conclude that individualism, more than any other idea, governs how white Americans think about racial inequality. Kinder Mendelberg disagree with Sniderman and Hagen, because of the measurement of individualism – they claim that S&H mix convictions about individual responsibility with resentment directed towards blacks. K&M bring up Jackman and his idea that not self-reliance, work or idleness, but rather primacy of individual rights is a morally charged category. They propose methodological fixes (does not seem to be a good solution), segmentation (only adds mystery), viewing individualism as an ideological weapon (they bring up Jackman and his view of the primacy of individual rights to be the morally charged aspect of individualism, they see it as promising). The one fix K&M like most is prejudice and racism. They say prejudice is expressed primarily in the language of individualism, today individualism is part of racism. Prejudice today is occupied with matters of moral character – blacks do not try hard enough & they get what they do not earn through subsidies. 

General conclusions from their own analysis:
1) individualism is large when whites think about social programs and fades away when they take up race
2) prejudice shows large effect on issues of race, but unimportant effect on social program that widely distribute benefits
3) on matters of race, in white opinion, the most important force is prejudice, sometimes properly conceived.

-> conservative attitudes toward racial policy are driven by prejudice

Comments:
Sidanius wouldn’t think so, b/c he believes in SDO, evolutionary imperatives. They would reply that Sidanius does not measure group dominance properly b/c he actually measures general attitudes towards equality in his questions. Sidanius in their view finds strong effects of racism on policy views due to SDO – both prejudice and egalitarianism influence white opinion – this is what they find as well.
Sniderman (according to K&M) would say that prejudice is one of many and not very important force, but K&M prejudice is most important force.},

- measuring response incomparability through the rating of hypothetical individuals described in short vignettes (on the same scale as the actual response)
- variability in vignette answers reveals incomparability b/w individuals (since vignettes are equal across individuals

problems with measurement adressed in the paper:
- how to measure concepts that are most clearly defined with reference examples (e.g. freedom, political efficacy etc.)
- individuals (respondents) understand the smae question in vastly different ways

main idea: directly measure incomparability in survey wuestions and then correct for it
- respondents are asked for self-assessments of the concept as well as for several hypothetical individuals described by short vignettes (on the same scale)
- adjustments can be made with simpoe calculations or more sophisticated statistical model

previous approaches: differential item functioning 
-> use of anchors (usually end-point of scale) 
-> but has problems

key assumptions:
- response consistency
- vignette equivalence

2 approaches they propose to correct for differential item functioning (DIF):
- simple (nonparametric approach)
- parametric statistical model

questions:
- what if the vignettes rather than the questions are interpreted differently?
- idea: using the same methodology for left-right party positions? -> get different interpretations for the political spectrum!},

Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors' own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use software that implements our suggestions.},

  abstract  = {Political ideology is not always best measured along a unidimensional spectrum. With a multidimensional construct, we are better able to understand the complexities of Americansï¿½ ideological views. This research note presents new survey data from a nationally representative sample of over 2,000 Americans. The survey asks respondents to place themselves on distinct ideological scales regarding social and economic issues, then to prioritize the importance of these issues. The first of its kind to include both ideological preferences and attitude importance, this survey contributes new insights into the complex dimensionality of ideology. Results reveal a plurality of individuals identifying as conservative on both social and economic issues, and a smaller group that is consistently liberal on both policy spectrums. Eleven percent of respondents self-identify as liberal on one scale and conservative on the other, yet choose to identify as ï¿½moderateï¿½ on the traditional unidimensional scale. By analyzing an extensive set of attitudinal and behavioral measures-including vote choice in the 2012 presidential election-this research demonstrates that true moderates are substantially different from those who mix both social and economic beliefs. It further shows that the vast majority of Americans place more importance on economic issues than on social issues, which has greater influence over respondentsï¿½ unidimensional ideological placement as well as their presidential vote choice. This study reveals important consequences of the multidimensional nature of ideology at the mass level.},

- experimental investigation of the role of social context and partisan ambivalence on political preference formation
- ambivalence and heterogeneity have similar but independent effects on reported preferences and the evaluation of policy efficiency
- heterogeneous groups also increase the desire for heterogeneous groups in the future -> I think this is a strange result...

experimental design:
- 2X3: induced ambivalence/univalence X discussion in homogeneous/heterogeneous groups
- discussion of two issues: energy policy and health care policy
- outcome measures: preferred policy choice, evaluate effectiveness of each party's policy, ideal discussion group according to ideological composition

hypotheses:
- univalent partisans -> preference for attitudinally congruent information, more motivated reasoning
- homogeneous group -> more partisan-motivated reasoning + higher perceived effectiveness (and vice versa)

results:
- differences in accordance with the hypotheses, group composition has a strong and independent effect beyond ambivalence
- partisan ambivalence (and heterogeneous groups) prefer more diverse information sources

questions/comments:
- can ambivalence and homogeneity/heterogeneity in social setting be conceptually distinguished?
- comparison b/w first part and second part would be interesting because participants then anticipate the interaction etc.
- people not engaged enough, maybe don't try to convince each other...
- why should respondents in more heterogeneous group prefer more diverse discussion group in the future?
- resuts for college democrats, generalizability might be problematic...
- question about group composition might make participants aware of the experiment etc...
- potential role of group identification rather than social interaction as such -> other factors about social context aside from homogeneity?},

In the second session, participants browsed articles. Four issues were covered by 8 articles, with 2 articles featuring opposing perspectives. Selective exposure was unobtrusively logged. Finally, participants completed measures for attitudes and partisanship again. Selective exposure to attitude-consistent articles was linked to greater attitude accessibility.

Results confirm that information utility can override a confirmation bias and motivate exposure if a government change is likely and the favored party is likely to lose the election. Moreover, participants with frequent habitual online news use do not exhibit a confirmation bias. However, participants whose favored party was likely to win the election and participants with infrequent online news consumption show a significant confirmation bias.},

-> advantage of MFQ over RWA due to the more in-depth understanding of potentially conflicting motivations connected to an issue

studies (large yourmorals.org samples):
1) moral disapproval for 13 social issues: abortion, the death penalty, medical testing with animals, euthanasia, same-sex marriage, homosexual relations, burning a US ﬂag, having a baby outside of marriage, stem cell research, pornography, gambling, casual sex, and animal cloning -> purity as strongest predictor in most issues
2) issue positions: abortion, defense spending, teaching evolution, same-sex marriage, the use of torture, global warming, burning a US ﬂag, stem cell research, combating terrorism, illegal immigration, and gun control -> different moral foundations have effect, purity mostly strongest

- influence of party: Looks at committee assignments. Finds that ideology and preferences better predict committee assignments (ie not much packing of committees).
- it's hard to find significant behavior 
- significant party behavior occurs if a MP votes for the party even if he/she doesn't want to (because the constituency doesn't want it) -> they are worried about party reputation!
- preferences lead to parties and preferences lead to policies -> relationship b/w parties and policies is only spurious -> significant party behavior only if there is actually case 
empirical investigation (measurement might be difficult (?)) -> goal: show that null hpothesis is true 
- evidence: research design to look at committee behavior

Summary:
Basically Krehbiel believes that parties as organizations do not exhibit strong effects and that people are simply driven by their own preferences. He defines significant party behavior as that which is consistent with known party objectives but independent of one’s own personal preferences. He seems to quibble with the notion that preferences precede parties and therefore parties are not really organizations but a collection of similar preferences. Overall, his definition of significant party behavior tries to separate preference from party influence. He criticizes scholars like Rhode for simply mislabeling ‘preferenceship’ as ‘partisanship’ and questions the significance of the role of parties (as he defines them).},

- previous research investigated how racial prejudice affects vote choice but not really the effect on turnout
- paper looks at interaction b/w partisanship and prejudice -> decision conflict: prejudiced white voters face Black candidate of their own partisanship -> leads to decrease in turnout
- decision conflict: Decision conﬂicts are situations in which none of the available alternatives emerge as sufﬁciently attractive on the attributes that are most important to the individual.
- prejudice does not have an effect on vote choice for strong partisans (!), but it does so for weak partisans 

questions/comments:
- social desirability in prejudice measure?
- non-response in surveys -> asking about vote choice
- endogeneity of partisanship measure as IV?
- less strong democrats who are prejudiced should change party if p(vote) does not change
- why predict no effect on vote choice for strong democrats? what about selesction model?
- question: is it a decision conflict in the survey response or in the actual behavior?
- other examples of decision conflict?
- multinomial logit problematic, violates iia assumption, modeling 2-step process would have been better, I think},

  comment   = {Two theories behind the functioning society with unsophisticated individuals:
- People use heuristics that can work
- Errors cancel in the aggregate

Arguments against Heuristics:
- Used “off the shelf”, unknowingly, automatically
- Lacking contextual knowledge to use them intelligently or at all
- Environmental info needed to use heuristics might not exist
- Criticizes Lupia’s 1994 Insurance study: being relatively informed (the people who scored high on information) can fall short of being actually well informed.
- The likability heuristic paired with Lupia’s findings has a cyclical argument

Arguments against error cancellation in the aggregate:
- Uncertain whether individual errors are random
- Media/information is unbalanced/unreliable -> collective bias
- Public opinion changes in the aggregate aren’t arbitrary -> Can follow the correct general pattern but still be unrealistic.

How we SHOULD study mass public opinion:
- Understand cognitive science: Cognition is hard-wired; Rooted in evolution; Modular; Methodologically problematic; Affected by emotion; Generates false beliefs to promote certain behavior
- Implications: Presumption of adaptability; Nature of heuristics; Expectations for citizen competence

Empirical Evidence of Bias:
- Do people form schemas/stereotypes about POLICIES? Yes.
- Overconfidence in one’s own knowledge
- Resistance to correction/ignoring new information
- Influence of easy arguments: will affect collective opinion
- Biased interpretation of messages
- Over response to policy positions- “molehill into mountains”

Real world consequences:
- “Deliberative polls” example
- Policy making -> Cites public’s erroneous opinion about aid to Russia

Conclusions:
- Humans are prone to bias and error due to the way our minds function and the way our environment is set up.
- People are good at broader, long-standing political ideas/questions: parties, social groups, ideologies etc.
- They do poorly with short-term singular events,'leaders, changing conditions etc},

- study shows that public is misinformed about welfare -> obstacle to educating the public with correct facts
- people often are not uninformed about policy, but misinformed: they hold inaccurate factual beliefs, do so confidently, and use it to form preferences
- misinformation leads to diverging collective preferences
- the psychology of misinformation is based on three mental processes that are inherent in human thinking
1) the drawing of social inferences
2) strong drive toward belief and attitude consistency
3) tendency to become overconfident in one's beliefs and judgments

main study:
- survey experiment with 1160 Rs, representative of Illinois residents, 3 randomly assigned groups (group 1 received factual items about welfare, group 2 received a quiz on the same items + confidence measure, group 3 received no treatment at all, then all received the same questions on policy preferences on social welfare)
- findings: widespread mistaken beliefs about the realities of welfare and people holding least accurate beliefs were most confident, factual beliefs and preferences are correlated, but corrective information can be effective if it "hits them between the eyes" (based on smaller student sample!)
- simulations show that misinformation leads to distorted aggregate preferences

new questions for future research:
1) What kinds of factual beliefs about public policy do people have (before they are asked factual questions by an interviewer)?
2) What is the direction of causality between beliefs and preferences? 
3) How widespread is misinformation? 
4) What is the relation between inaccuracy and confidence? 
5) What causes people to be misinformed about political phenomena?
6) Finally, and ultimately of most practical importance, under what conditions can misinformation be overcome?},

Two-thirds of this variation can be explained jointly by two macro factors: the effect is stronger in larger welfare states where elites and citizens may perceive EU-induced obstacles for welfare state expansion. Likewise, it is stronger in political systems where the most Eurosceptic parties have tended to be the most welfare state-supporting ones. Under such conditions, it is more probable that citizens receive political cues conducive to a negative effect of dissatisfaction on EU trust.},

Using surveys, both sides of the debate have found support for their preferred theory, but disagreement remains because of differing ways of analyzing the data. Lewis and King (2000) point out that these researchers make assumptions that bias results in favor of their theory. To avoid these difficulties, our approach creates fictitious candidates with controlled positions, presents these candidates to randomly-assigned subjects, and examines the relationship between subjectsï¿½ evaluations of these candidates and their ideological beliefs as a neutral test of proximity and directional theory. Our results provide reasonably strong support for proximity theory but little for directional theory.

While several existing studies find that media trust moderates media effects, they do not examine the consequences of this for voting. This paper explores those consequences by analyzing voting behavior in the 2004 presidential election. It finds, consistent with most theories of persuasion and with studies of media effects in other contexts, that media distrust leads voters to discount campaign news and increasingly rely on their partisan predispositions as cues. This suggests that increasing aggregate levels of media distrust are an important source of greater partisan voting.},

morality as moral accounting: 
- moral action is conceptualized in terms of financial transaction

- basic moral schemes: reciprocation, retribution, revenge, restitution, altruism, turning the other cheek

experiental morality 
- morality is not all metaphorical, metaphorical system is based on nonmetaphorical aspects 
- basic form: promotion of experiental well-being, prevention of harm from others

conservative ideology: 
- moral strength is most important: self discipline + self-denial

- but: there is a list of other metaphors that are also important: moral bounds etc. 
=> strict father model underlies all conservative thought -> nation as family metaphor

liberal ideology: 
=> nuturant parent model 
- metaphors: morality as empathy, ...

Overall distinction of ideology by relative importance of metaphors:

- Strict Father Morality (Basic Conservative Morality): The Strength Complex; Moral Self-interest; The Nurturance Complex. 
- Nurturant Parent Morality (Basic Liberal Morality): The Nurturance Complex; Moral Self-interest; The Strength Complex. 
- Moderate Conservative Morality: Moral Self-interest; The Strength Complex; The Nurturance Complex. 
- Moderate Liberal Morality: Moral Self-interest; The Nurturance Complex; The Strength Complex.

moral pathologies: criticism on structural or empirical ground 
- Deviational Pathology: Here, a deviation from an ideal model turns out to harm people the ideal model was supposed to help. 
- Foundational Pathology: Here, a moral system contradicts its own foundations. 
- Empirical Pathology: Here, the moral system simply makes an empirical error about the helpful effects it is supposed to produce.},

- An experiment awarded the monkeys with treats of either fixed or probabilistic quantity (equivalent expected value). The treats are framed as either a gain or a loss using a baseline quantity of treats that is either above or below the fixed outcome.
- The monkeys tended to choose the probabilistic outcome in the loss condition, and the fixed outcome in the gain condition. This is consistent with the predicted framing effects of prospect theory.
- Question: Are there alternative explanations for why we observe these effects in primates? 
- Question: Is there reason to believe that framing effects in general have evolutionary origin, or does the evolutionary story only apply in certain contexts?},

Much of this scholarship has focused on colonialismï¿½s institutional legacies; has neglected to distinguish among the actors associated with colonialism; and has been nation-state focused. Our subnational approach allows us to isolate the democracy effects of key actors operating in colonial domains-Christian missionaries-from those of colonial powers. Missionaries influenced democracy by promoting education; education promoted social inclusivity and spurred social reform movements. To make our case, we constructed colonial and postcolonial period district datasets of India and conducted panel analysis of literacy and democracy variations backed by case studies. The findings challenge the conventional wisdom of the centrality of the effects of British institutions on democracy, instead also highlighting the missionariesï¿½ human capital legacies.},

Welche Art der Operationalisierung von CV ist am sinnvollsten? Hypothese: We hypothesize that differences in cognitive capacity, political motivation, the availability of political heuristics, and macrolevel factors that affect the difficulty of the choice confronting citizens, including the nature of the political information environment, should all affect the probability of a correct vote. Individual level: 1. The more motivated citizens are to make good decisions-the more it matters to them which candidate win-the higher the probability of their voting correctly. 2. Political experts (most immediatley) and possibly also those with higher basic intelligence should have a higher probability of voting correctly. 3. The use of prominent political heuristics should also be positively related to correct voting. Paradoxically, however, we expect heuristics to be most effectiv in the hands of political experts. Hence we predict an interaction between political knowledge and the availiability or salience of political heuristics. State Level: 4. The more heavily the presidential candidates campaign in a state, the higher the probability of a correct vote in that presidential election. 5. The greater the number of other high profile elections on the ballot, however, the lower the probability of a correct vote (in the presidential election). Election-Year Level: 6. Any factor that makes the decision task objectively more difficult (e.g., more than two alternatives) should lower the probability of a correct vote. 7. Any factor that makes the decision task easier (e.g., more ideologically distinct alternatives) ought to increase the probability of a correct vote. Methode: Multilevel-Analyse mit Einflussfaktoren auf drei verschiedenen Ebenen (siehe Hypothesen) Datengrundlage: Umfragedaten fï¿½r amerikanische Prï¿½sidentschaftswahlen 1988-2004. Ergebnisse: Hypothesen werden weitestgehend bestï¿½tigt (es stellt sich teilweise die Frage der Robustheit) Individuallevel: political motivation, policy-based distinctiveness, one measure of cognitive capacity sind dominante Faktoren (?) Autoren verwenden in den Analysen die ï¿½weighted additiveï¿½ Methode. Relevanz fï¿½r die BA-Arbeit: Die Studie konzentriert sich auf die Anwendung des Konzepts auf Umfragedaten und behandelt unterschiedliche Berechnungsarten von CV.

Given limited cognitive resources, voters are more likely to make correct decision when there are fewer candidates than when there are more alternatives in the choice set. This suggests that voters were more likely to make correct choices in 1972, 1976, 1984, and 1988 than in 1980, when there was a reasonably successful third-party candidate running in the general election. 2. If the number of candidates is held constant, then voters will be more likely to make correct decisions when the candidates are easy to distinguish than when they are difficult to distinguish. This suggests rates of correct voting were higher in 1972, 1984, and 1988, when more ideologically extreme candidates captured the two parties' nominations, than in 1976, when more centrist candidates opposed each other. 3. All else equal, voters will be more likely to make correct decisions when campaign resources are reasonably balanced, giving all candidates an equal opportunity to get their case across, than when re-sources are imbalanced. Phrased more cynically, this suggests that candidates whose campaign resources are greater than those of opponents can attract more support than should have been the case if everyone had voted "correctly." ï¿½Impliziteï¿½ Hypothesen: (bzgl. Der Validierung mit Experimentaldaten) Ob der ï¿½richtigeï¿½ Kandidat gewï¿½hlt wurde spiegelt sich in der Wahrscheinlichkeit wieder, die Entscheidung im Experiment tatsï¿½chlich nochmal zu ï¿½ndern.

  abstract       = {This article challenges the often untested assumption that cognitive "heuristics" improve the decision-making abilities of everyday voters. The potential benefits and costs of five common political heuristics are discussed. A new dynamic process-tracing methodology is employed to directly observe the use of these five heuristics by voters in a mock presidential election campaign. We find that cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex. A hypothesized interaction between political sophistication and heuristic use on the quality of decision making is obtained across several different experiments, however. As predicted, heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices. A situation in which experts can be led astray by heuristic use is also illustrated. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for strategies to increase input from under-represented groups into the political process.},
  comment        = {Background: Background research is that heuristics are good and efficient way for voters to make decisions. Implications for normative democracy – i.e. how can democracy function when people know so little?
The Question: Can everyone use heuristics equally? Are they always good for democracy?
The Theory: Not everyone uses heuristics equally well, namely people who are less sophisticated cannot use them as well. Sophisticates may also determine who uses which heuristic. They posit that nearly everyone uses one. Because heuristics are shortcuts, they should be used more often in complex situations. Heuristics will result in “right” decisions, but more for political experts. Complexity was operationalized by a static or dynamic information board and by number of candidates.

The Method: information board – dynamic process tracing model. They determine which heuristic (party ideology endorsement appearance viability/horse race ) is being used based on the information a person selects.
Findings: 1. People use heuristics (can they really prove this with the information board?). Perhaps politically sophisticated use party more and less sophisticated use appearance more 2. Subjects were more likely to use heuristics with the dynamic rather than static board. And have mixed results from the number of candidates manipulation (Subjects were slightly (and nonsignificantly) more likely to employ the Ideology and Candidate appearance heuristics in the four candidate condition than the two candidate condition, but significantly more likely to employ the Endorsement and Viability heuristics in the two candidate condition). 3. Political sophisticates are more likely to be able to use heuristics to make the correct vote choice. They also say that absent heuristics political sophisticates are not any more likely to make a correct vote choice.
Critical Thoughts: There are problems here with measurement. 1. The information board where people just get to choose what they want to see means that heuristic use may be confounded with a lot of other factors (like education). 2. Measuring what articles they looked at as heuristic usage is questionable 3. The idea that political sophisticates make the correct vote choice only with heuristics (here meaning reading certain articles) and not because they are politically sophisticated is kind of ridiculous.

Quick summary:
Use a “dynamic process tracing methodology” (dynamic message board) to create a mock presidential campaign and ndthat heuristics are used by most voters, particularly when the political context is complex. Heuristic use increases accuracy among informed voters, but can lead to incorrect vote choice when used by non—sophisticates. However, even political sophisticates’ use of heuristics can fail if the political environment is structured in a non-stereotypical way.

=====================================================================================

- Five heuristics: PID, Ideology, endorsement, polling and appearance (these are not actually heuristics except for maybe PID, the others are just affective infusion. Ideology is in no way a heuristic)
- Heuristics most useful for political experts because they how to get the most out of their knowledge. They can employ the heuristics more appropriately. They will also use the ideology and endorsement heuristic more. 
- Use dynamic information board – if people are using a heuristic, they should seek out information relevant to it early and often. 
- More knowledgable use the endorsement and ideology schema more 
- Notice the change to the word schema for party and ideology rather than heuristic (Lau ***).
- Used correct voting measure (booo)
- Interaction between sophistication and heuristic use in correct voting model.
- High sophisticates do better with high heuristic use, low sophisticates do worse. If low heuristic use, no difference between low and high sophisticates, suggesting that they are better because they can use information better through heuristics (but of course the things that they are measuring like ideology are not actually ideology). 
- Further complicated by another interaction with stereotypical and non-stereotypical candidate, The pattern is reverse for non-stereotypical candidates, then high sophisticates who use heuristics vote worse and low sophisticates who use heuristics do better.},

  comment   = {Summary:
The information flow during presidential campaigns is intense and two-sided, providing voters with contradicting information about the candidates and rendering them ambivalent. Ambivalence is thus a fundamental aspect of mass belief systems and electoral choice. Its consequences cannot be explained by other fundamental aspects like partisanship, sophistication, attitude strength. It’s unique. The main consequences of ambivalence are: judgmental unreliability and context dependence. For elections this translates into: i) ambivalent voters are more instable in their candidate evaluation over the course of a campaign; ii) it takes ambivalent voters longer to reach a crystallized vote decision; iii) ambivalent voters decide their vote choice later; iv) the usual vote determinants (issue proximity and candidate evaluation) are more predictive for univalent voters than ambivalent voters.

Method: 
ANES data. He looks at the open ended candidate likes and dislikes questions and calculates ambivalence of every respondent towards every candidate with the well established formula by Thompson, Zanna and Griffin (1995). Then he regresses all the proposed consequences as dependent variables on ambivalence and the other control variables (pi, sophistication, attitude strength) and shows that ambivalence still has an (independent) effect on them even controlling for the other aspects.},

- party unity has 2 effects: 
(1) direct negative effect: constituents punish you for too much party unity, you vote with the party too often 
(2) indirect positive effect: increased party unity increases electoral success, which increases the probability of getting reelected 
-> parties want to be just unified enough to win
- it's about the relative level of party unity as well as the size of the party 
- a party with a large majority doesn't need cohesiveness, it only needs a simple majority
- macro-perspective on party, doesn't look at individual members of parliament
- Parties choose an amount of influence that maximizes electoral gains of legislative victory while minimizing the electoral costs of partisan influence
- Parties respond to the party unity of the opposite party and they close any gap between the two in party unity

Summary:
CPG shows that influencing legislative outcomes requires costly effort. Assuming that parties improve reputation by winning legislative battles, SPG states that parties should choose a level of party influence that maximizes electoral gains and minimizes electoral costs (because partisanship has negative effect on electoral fortunes but positive effect on electoral success). Thus, parties are always debating whether they should be seen as policymaking machines or reputation-protecting cartels. Two main hypotheses are: 1)As Democratic party unity increases so should Republican and 2)Parties will correct for differences in party unity by moving towards opposition’s unity level, in either real-time or lagged time. That is, opposition unity is the strongest determinant of party unity (strategic party competition).},

This paper addresses three main questions. First, are individual demographicharacteristics as influential in predicting turnout in 1984 as Wolfinger and Rosenstone found they were in 1972? Second, do individual characteristics lessen in importance when systemic factors are controlled for? And, third, to what extent does the effect of individual characteristics vary across different regions? Data on individual demographicharacteristics are taken from the Census Bureau's November 1984 Current Population Survey and merged with systemic data. We find that race and sex have become much stronger predictors of turnout than they were in 1972, though education is still the primary determinant of voting. These relationships hold even when systemic variables are included in the turnout model.},

- priming effects are not due to actual priming but rather a product of two processes:

2) individuals adopt their preferred party/candidate's postition
- analyses show that priming effects only occur among respondents learned/updated the party position
- cross-lagged panel/granger causality, show that learning leads to issue opinion change, not vote change
- cases: European Integration in the 1997 British Election, Social Security in 2000 US Presidential Election, public work jobs 1976 election, 1980 defense spending
- normative aspect: priming is bad since people are manipulated, learning is good, becuase people are better informed

- showing that learning happens does not necessarily imply that priming does not take place...
- people who knew the information before might have been "primed" prior to the campaign

- motivation to avoid emotions is related to political conservatism 
- conservatism: managing uncertainty, emphasizes ego-control 
-> Hypothesis: "individuals motivated to avoid emotions should fit better within a conservative worldview, whereas individuals motivated to approach emotional experiences should perceive a miss-match between their need and conservatism"

- IV: need for affect scales: emotion approach and emotion avoidance as 2 independent dimensions - DVs: RWA ("resistance to change"); SDO ("acceptance of inequality"); support for a set of conservative policies - controls: need for cognitive closure

Findings: 
- emotion avoidance -> more right-wing authoritarianism/social dominance orientation/support for conservative policies 
- emotion apporach -> less conservatism measures

Questions: 
- why are emotion avoidance and emotion approach independent of each other? this orthogonality is not reflected in the theoretical argument 
- what about the causal direction? 
- how do the results/theoretical predictions relate to other findings such as Dodd et al. 2012? -> seems to be contradicting because Dodd finds that conservatives are more attentive to negative stimuli},

- Impact of anger on judgment and decision making (outcome of anger rather anger and its elicitation) perceptions, beliefs, ideas, reasoning, and ultimately choices
- Anger is one of the most frequently experienced emotions—at least among individuals in the United States intercountry variations in the frequency of experiencing emotions? Can socialization impact the intensity of emotions? Or are they a universal component of human nature?
- Anger is different from other emotions in its association to certainty, control, and responsibility, its effects on judgments relevant to these dimensions will be distinct from other negative emotions (against the global negative/ positive valence assumptions)
- Appraisal tendencies are goal-directed processes through which emotions exert effects upon judgment and choice until the emotion-eliciting problem is resolved. Such appraisals, although tailored to help the individual respond to the event that evoked the emotion, persist beyond the eliciting situation—becoming an unconscious perceptual lens for interpreting subsequent judgments and choice process and outcome effect 

Outcome: anger does not necessarily trigger an undifferentiated negative outlook (or mood congruency).
- Rather, at least in the case of anger and sadness, they have unique effects.
 -> Effects on evaluating outgroup members and people who are not involved the anger- causing process
 -> Risk perception shows different effects of fear and anger: whereas angry people made optimistic risk assessments more optimistic judgments and choices about themselves than do people induced to feel fear.
- Varying cognitive appraisals: fear and anger create opposing perceptual lenses or ‘‘appraisal tendencies,’’ anger increasing perceived control and certainty, fear decreasing such perceptions
- Varying biological stress responses is whether an emotion is associated with a sense of individual control and predictability rather than whether an emotion is associated with negativity.

Process: an attention effect and a depth of processing effect
- attention effect: Optimism that anger triggers pertains to the self and not to outcomes for others; It triggers a bias toward seeing the self as powerful and capable.
- depth of processing effect: Participants induced to feel angry do not engage in the same careful and detailed processing as those who have been induced to feel ‘‘negative affect’’; Processing effects of emotional states may be best predicted by understanding the appraisal content of those emotion the certainty dimension is more important than the valence dimension in determining whether an emotion results in heuristic or systematic processing; Feeling uncertain has consistently been linked with more systematic processing and feeling certain with more heuristic processing.

Mechanisms underlying these processes: Associative network mechanism; Information mechanism; Motivational mechanism
- Different effects of anger based on backward or forward reflection
- Emotion mix (more likely to encounter?) emotional ambivalence, although a mix of two emotions, has an appraisal profile that is distinct from its constituent emotions},

Nearly all of the empirical support for these theories, however, comes from cross-sectional data. As a result, these findings are typically biased, and systematically overstate the effect of information on behavior. I demonstrate how to minimize these biases and more accurately estimate the effects of information using several different analytical techniques. These adjustments cause the estimated effect of information to shrink dramatically, often falling to one-half to one-quarter of its former size. I conclude by discussing the implications of my results for the study of political information and political behavior more generally.},

- effect of political information on political behavior (turnout and other forms of participation) is usually overstated in traditional cross-sectional studies 
- main reason: lots of observed/unobserved confounders that determine both, pol info and behavior 
- strategy in this paper: panel design + matching and regression design that captures within-individual effects 
- result: effects of information are much smaller if confounding factors are accounted for, however some 

problems remain (check conclusion)
- if we take into account unobserved variables etc. the effect of political knowledge is rather modest! 
- but: what about the unobserved factors that determine political knowledge as well as behavior? which are the factors that account for the variance? what are we missing?

We report the results of an experiment designed to test the voter turnout predictions of the rational choice Palfreyï¿½Rosenthal model of participation with asymmetric information. We find that the three main comparative statics predictions are observed in the data: the size effect, whereby turnout goes down in larger electorates; the competition effect, whereby turnout is higher in elections that are expected to be close; and the underdog effect, whereby voters supporting the less popular alternative have higher turnout rates. We also compare the quantitative magnitudes of turnout to the predictions of Nash equilibrium. We find that there is undervoting for small electorates and overvoting for large electorates, relative to Nash equilibrium. These deviations from Nash equilibrium are consistent with the logit version of Quantal Response Equilibrium, which provides a good fit to the data, and can also account for significant voter turnout in very large elections.},

  abstract  = {Two experiments demonstrate the powerful influence of others’ views on individual attitudes and attitude expression. Those around us can influence our views through persuasion and information exchange, but the current research hypothesizes that exposure to alternate views even without discussion or exchange of persuasive arguments can also alter what attitudes are expressed, and even generate long term shifts in attitudes. In an initial study, naïve participants were asked their attitudes on a range of standard survey items privately, publicly in a group with trained confederates, and again privately following the group setting. Findings indicate significant attitudinal conformity, which was most pronounced when participants were faced with a unanimous (versus non-unanimous) group. The group experience continued to influence participants’ views when they were again asked their views in private. A second experiment varied whether participants heard views from live confederates or via computer, demonstrating that these effects could not be attributed only to issue-relevant information provided by or inferred from group members, and that attitude change persisted long after participants had left the laboratory. In summary, when people are asked their attitudes publicly, they adjust their responses to conform to those around them, and this attitude change persists privately, even weeks later. Accordingly, such purely social processes of attitude change may be every bit as important as more traditional cognitive informational processes in understanding where people’s political attitudes come from, and how they may be changed.},

- Negativity bias is closely related to loss aversion and this could help explain why voters place more weight on negative attitudes for candidate evaluation than they do for positive attitudes
- Argues that presidential primaries and social welfare are possible applications of prospect theory in American politics
- Validating prospect theory hypotheses are very difficult becausesubjective probabilities and the weighting functions are difficult to measure

=================================================================

- Instant endowment effect – people renormalize their reference point much more quickly after making gains than losses – state that gains territory renormalize but states the lose territory never do.
- Actual losses hurt more than actual gains of the same magnitude. 
- Status quo bias predicted by prospect theory and is evident in IR because states will fight harder to maintain the status quo from loss than to get a gain. 
- Deterrence is easier than compellence – easier to deter an action than it is to compel someone to stop an action. 

Conceptions of Fairness and the Law – asymmetry of losses and gains:
-Norms of hurting someone are stronger than norms of helping others.
-Essential to low – possession is 9/10s of the law – endowment effect and the power of the status quo, people should be able keep their possessions until someone else demonstrates a better title.
-Presumption that the legal system should favor protection of loss over protection of profits denied.},

We demonstrate here that the empirical tests in the large and growing body of literature on this subject amount to theoretical debates about which statistical assumption is right. The key statistical assumptions have not been empirically tested and, indeed, turn out to be effectively untestable with existing methods and data. Unfortunately, these assumptions are also crucial since changing them leads to different conclusions about voter decision processes.},

Five propositions regarding structural differentiation are tested by fitting a cyclical autoregressive-moving-average model to each of the electoral time series and then comparing their estimated coefficients. The results reveal several general patterns: (1) The House elections contain a more stable basic trend than the presidential elections (largely due to the predominant impact of party and incumbency in House elections). (2) The presidential elections, in contrast, are more responsive to short-term effects than the House elections. (3) The presidential electoral realighnments appear stronger than House realignments. (4) The off-year House elections contain a more stable basic trend than the on-year House elections. (5) The on-year House elections, in contrast, are more responsive to short-term disturbances than off-year elections, mostly as a result of presidential coattail effect},

Although most comparative research assumes that cross-national comparisons of voters and parties are possible, few correct for systematic biases commonly known to exist in surveys or examine whether survey data are comparable across countries. Our scaling method addresses scale perception in surveys and links cross-national surveys through new bridging observations. We apply our approach to the 2009 European Election Survey and demonstrate that the improvement in party estimates that one gains from fixing various survey bias issues is significant. Our scaling strategy provides left-right positions of voters and of 162 political parties, and we demonstrate that variables based on rescaled voter and party positions on the left-right dimension significantly improve the fit of a cross-national vote choice model.},

- partisan schematics (high sophisticates, developed knowledge structure about politics) are better able to classify campaign statements as Rep/Dem than aschematics (low sophistication)
- there is a consistency bias among schematics: they recall more policy statements that are consistent with a congressman's party identification

study design:
- Long Island Sample (N=603)
- R's received policy information about fictional congressman (described as Rep vs. Dem), where some information is consistent and some is inconsistent with the respective party platform. After a distraction task, R's are asked to state whether they recognize some of the policies they read about earlier (recognition task was unexpected)

- partisan schematics are more accurate in categorizing party-relevant information than aschematics
- schematics remember more information that is consistent with the partisan schema than aschematics
- schematics remember more schema-consistent than schema-inconsistent information
-> facilitation and liability effects, biased information processing that is consistent with partisan stereotypes

  comment   = {overview:
- citizens are responsive to campaign information by updating their on-line tally -> on-line model instead of memory-based processing
- recall of actual pieces of information is actually not necessary

study:
- student sample, received campaign information, recontacted via phone after varying numbers of days
- processing-depth manipulation -> some respondents were asked to think more about the issues etc.

results:
- memory retrieval of actual facts decays quickly, but respondents are still able to give accurate candidate evaluations -> online tally
- campaigns can matter, people don't have to remember campaign details in order for campaigns to have an effect
-> voters don’t have to know how they made a decision for it to be a good one. Recall of messages was bad, but affect towards the message at time one, predicted evaluations quite well at time 2

================================================================

overview:
- Online model solution to problem of ignorant citizens who can make rational political decisions. This is how people make decisions w/o remembering the reasons why; all they need is recall the evaluation.
- Basic Idea: Running tally of updating evaluation w/new info exposure
- “OL model posits that the OL tally is responsive to the gist and specifiers of campaign messages but that, over time, first the specifiers and then the gists will be forgotten. If so, the OL model would portray the voter as responsive, while a memory-based model would picture the very same voters as unaware and ignorant.”

Empirics: 
- exposed to info about candidates, manipulated consistency of candidate party id & policy stances 
- processing-depth manipulation to think more about candidate
- give time delay for post-test anywhere from 1-31 days (random assignment to amount of delay)
- candidate evaluations and recall

Results:
- Table 2: What you remember does not predict overall evaluation, “message” is significant predictor which includes all info exposed to and average rating of all info received.
- “Voters are responsive to political campaigns. No matter how little voters may recall from the campaign, our evidence suggests that if attentive to campaign issues and events, they use this information to inform their candidate evaluations.”
- Non-typical Dem candidate deeper processing of candidate should lead to more memories of candidate. But, if can’t use schema (party id) to define candidate maybe harder to remember. Can’t use heuristics to make judgment; recall becomes better predictor so more memory based.
-> Party ID predicts people who pay most attention to update model; partisanship is an affective attachment (like in American Voter)

Take-away:
- people can have rational political attitudes/preferences w/o need to know or recall all of the information leading to that position. Normatively good for democracy.

Criticism:
- Weighting all info coming in equally – is this realistic of the cognitive process? Used fictional instead of real candidates, perhaps people can better remember info about a real candidate},

  comment   = {- experimental test of hot cognition hypothesis
- includes some arguments about the normative relevane

- People have faster reaction times to affectively congruent concepts than affectively incongruent concepts. The logic of Hot Cognition is that some nodes within memory are more closely/strongly linked, thus leading to more accessibility among certain concepts. Hot cognition is most prominent among those with strong attitudes. 
- Overall, affect towards sociopolitical concepts is activated automatically, especially among sophisticates/people with strong attitudes (leads to a discussion of motivated reasoning/biased info processing). 
- The logic of the experiment is to test reaction times, because congruent concepts should be more easily accessible and so reactions should be quicker.
- Implications: Since affect is primary, there’s no way to get around the motivated biases when citizens encounter information that is contrary to their beliefs.
- Links to other literature: Howie seems to think that people can be less biased if they have competing motivations to seek more objective information. Does this contradict Chuck and Milt’s argument?

==========================================================

I. What do they do?
Test the hot cognition part of their dual-process model of motivated political reasoning: All sociopolitical objects are affectively charged, and that this affect is automatically activated upon encountering said objects in the world. This affective charge precedes and colors all subsequent processing, leading (downstream) to biased reasoning about political objects; feelings serve as information. In addition, political sophisticates and those with strong prior attitudes will be more likely to have developed stronger evaluative OL tallies, leading these individuals to exhibit the strongest effects. 

Theoretical Background:
- Nodes and links in LTM. The links represent beliefs, with varying strengths. 
- Varied accessibility of memory objects- the ease with which concept can be brought from LTM to WM.
- Affect is automatically linked with objects in LTM, and this affect can be positive, negative, and varies in strength.
- LTM -> WM through spreading activation. Threshold determines if something gets into WM. Priming facilitates this process. Expected things get over threshold faster, while unexpected things are inhibited. 
- Attitudes in memory are associations between an object and an evaluation (a la Fazio). The strength of this association can vary from nonexistent (nonattitude, i.e., Converse) to strong. The stronger the associative strength between an object and its affective evaluation, the easier it is to bring the attitude to mind. 

II. How do they do it?
Three experiments using attitude-priming paradigm, which test for automaticity of affect associated with political objects – if previously thought about objects automatically activate affective evaluations automatically, we should see facilitation when paired with affect congruent targets, and inhibition when paired with affect incongruent objects. Since the primes and targets are unrelated semantically (especially in studies 2 and 3), this teases out the specific effects of affect.
- Experiment 1 and 2: 2 (SOA, long vs. short) x 2 (prime valence, positive vs. negative) x 2 (target valence, positive vs. negative) mixed model designs
- Experiment 3: Same as 1 & 2 but SOA manipulated within subjects
- Prime examples:
 - Persons: Bush, Clinton, Gore, Hitler. 
 - Groups: Democrat, Republican, African Americans, Terrorists. 
 - Issues: Death penalty, peace, taxes, welfare
- Target examples: Appealing, awful, cancer, death, grief, rainbow, rabies.
- Questionnaire/Measures: Valence of prime; strength of valence; political sophistication 

Results:
- Hot cognition hypothesis: Across all three experiments, for all political primes taken together, patterns support hypotheses. That is, under short SOA’s for affectively congruent prime-target pairs, RT’s were shorter (facilitation) than for incongruent pairs (inhibition). This provides evidence for the primacy and automaticity of affect.
- Prime types: At short SOA’s, facilitation of RT’s was found for congruent prime-target pairs, and inhibition for incongruent pairs for each of the prime types. This provides evidence that tallies exist for a wide range of political objects (persons, groups, and issues).
- Sophistication effects: Study 2 found only found sophistication effects for issues. Sophisticate effects were as expected in study 3. This pattern may have emerged due to the relatively mainstream nature of persons and group primes in study 2.
- Ambivalence and attitude strength: Neither ambivalent nor weak primes elicited the facilitation/inhibition effect, but strong and unambivalent primes did.

  author    = {Lodge, Milton and Taber, Charles S},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  title     = {The Rationalizing Voter},
  year      = {2013},
  comment   = {The figure is the basic model of the book. They call it the dual process model of cognition. 
Motivated reasoning – means that a person is likely to interpret new events and information to be congruent with previous beliefs and affect even when the new information is contradictory. Online tally is the idea that people have running total of affect combined with opinion on a subject. They may forget the specific pieces of information, but have the overall idea. 

Critical Thoughts: There are criticisms of specific parts of the model and criticisms of the overall model. For example one critique of motivated reasoning is that it does not allow for opinion change and we know opinions sometime change (like Redlawsk et. al 2010). Likewise, there are problems with the online tally – like do all pieces of information receive the same weight (think of the Nyhan et. al 2014? article from public opinion about misinformation correcting). However, it seems like the resolution to these points is to just say that well not everyone is a motivated reasoned, and even those who are, are not necessarily motivated reasoners all the time. 
Another line of critique comes from 1. The affective intelligence theory (MacKuen), where affect inspires behavior instead of dictating beliefs and 2. The emotions literature in general that posits different roles for discrete emotions.

CHAPTER 5:
- “Affect transfer” refers to processes operating within arrow “d” below. Affectively positive primes will tend to transfer their affect to considerations activated from memory. This causes individuals to evaluate candidates more positively when positive affect is primed.
- Affect transfer effects are accentuated among sophisticated individuals because they usually have more considerations activated. Thus, positive primes can spread further.
- Two experiments using hypothetical candidates and mock newspaper articles support the affect transfer and sophistication hypotheses.
- Manipulating deliberation allows the authors the show that affective transfer effects are heightened with greater activation of considerations, in general (i.e. not just among sophisticates).
- Question: Is affect transfer a motivated reasoning process?
- Question: Do primes need to be connected to the evaluative task in order for affect transfer to occur?

CHAPTER 6:
- Whereas affective transfer refers to the affective nature of primes influencing activated considerations, “affective contagion” refers to the process by which affective primes cause affectively congruent considerations to be activated. Affectively positive stimuli cause positive thoughts, and vice versa.
- Affectively biased thoughts mediate the effect of primes on attitudes formation. There is no expected direct transfer of affect from primes to attitudes.
- Affective contagion does not require that the original prime be directly related to the attitude object.
- Results from two experiments indicate that brief subliminal priming had a greater effect on the affective direction of thoughts than prior attitudes on an issue (!).
- The mediational effect of thoughts is also supported. Primes influenced the thoughts subjects brought to mind, which in turn influenced posterior attitudes.
- Question: Do primes require reinforcement for the contagion effect to persist?
- Question: Do more recent primes supersede the effect prior ones, or is it the aggregate affect of primes over some period of time that matters?
- Question: What is the connection between affective contagion and motivated reasoning?

CHAPTER 8:
- Previous chapters tested individual hypotheses derived from the JQP model. In this chapter, the authors develop and apply a computational model designed to test whether JQP functions reasonably well as a whole, behaving like real individuals evaluating political objects.
- The computational model is simulated against data from the 2000 NAES.
- Patterns of simulated evaluations closely matched actual evaluations of Bush and Gore throughout the 2000 presidential election cycle. The model also correctly predicted polarization of candidate evaluation differentials.
- JQP outperforms simulations using a Bayesian rational learning model in comparison to the NAES.
- The best performing model is one in which both memory-based and on-line processes are used (hybrid model).
- Question: Are any of the processes in the JQP model neglected by the computational modeling approach? 
- Question: JQP predicts moderates less accurately than ideologues in the simulations. Are there substantive reasons relating to the model such that we’d expect this to be the case?

CHAPTER 9:
- Recap of findings.
- Comparison of JQP to other prominent models of political attitudes, such as receive-accept-sample (Zaller) and Affective Intelligence (Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen).
- Snap judgments often outperform elaborated decisions when faced with complex, multidimensional choices.
- Discussion of rationality.
- Question: How does the JQP model account for evidence purportedly supporting memory-based/cognitive models (e.g. recall correlates with evaluations).
- Question: Practically speaking, what is JQP useful for explaining or predicting? Some theories can be described as models of survey response or attitude reports. Is JQP useful beyond these purposes?},

Affect in decision-making:
- Incidental affect as unrelated but influential to the decision at hand
- Emotional deficits diminishes quality of decision- making
- Increased explanatory power by incorporating emotions

Two types of affective intelligence:
- Expected emotions
- Immediate emotions 


1) Expected emotions (emotions as the outcome):

- Decision- making under risk
 -> First innovation: asset integration incremental gains rather than overall levels of wealth
 -> Second innovation: Counterfactual comparisons 
 -> Third innovation: Nonlinear probability weighting 

- Intertemporal choice (consequences delayed in time)
 -> Hyperbolic discounting (emphasis on immediate consequences impulsivity, particularly for good associated with hunger, thirst, anger and fear and even sex)
 -> Shows the intertwined nature of immediate and expected emotions

- Affective forecasting
 -> People make systematic errors when predicting their future tastes because of
 -> Under appreciation of their own powers of adaptation to both favorable and unfavorable events
 -> The tendency to exaggerate the hedonic impact of any event on which one’s attention is focused


2) Immediate emotions:

- Direct effects (during decision- making): Low and moderate levels of intensity; Affect- as- information hypothesis 
- High levels of intensity: Emotions overwhelm cognitive processing and deliberate decision- making
- Indirect effects 
 -> Influence on judgments of the probability of positive and negative outcomes
 -> Indirect effects on the nature of processing: Negative emotions narrow attentional focus and positive emotions broaden attentional focus
 -> Indirect effects on depth of processing: More systematic processing due to negative emotions (e.g. stereotypes and attribution error)
 -> Determinants of immediate emotions: Anticipatory influences (present feelings stem from anticipated choices or utilities); Incidental influences (present feelings stem from factors unrelated to the decision at hand)},

In this article, the authors report on a new database on diamond deposits and production and analyze the relationship between diamonds and armed conflict incidence. They find a strong bivariate relationship between diamonds (particularly secondary diamonds) and the onset of civil war. Adding diamond dummies to standard models of civil war, the results are more mixed. The production of secondary diamonds increases the risk of onset of ethnic war, but not other types of war. The authors find evidence that secondary diamonds are positively related to the incidence of civil war, especially in countries divided along ethnic lines. Primary diamonds, on the other hand, make ethnic war onset and incidence less likely. The authors also find that the impact of diamonds has been substantially stronger in the post-cold war era.},

Cognitive processing mediated the effects of motivation on attitudes, which were stable across measurements. In Experiment 2, 44 participants processed under two combined strong motivations. Accuracy was successfully combined with directional motivation in both processing and attitudes. It reduced bias when combined with impression motivation but not when combined with defensive motivation. Two opposing directional motivations were difficult to combine, and participants eventually abandoned extensive processing.},

While some scholars argue that an electorate of well-informed voters is necessary for the production of responsive electoral outcomes, others argue that apparently ignorant voters will suffice because they can adapt their behavior to the complexity of electoral choice. To evaluate the validity of these arguments, I develop and analyze a survey of California voters who faced five complicated insurance reform ballot initiatives. I find that access to a particular class of widely available information shortcuts allowed badly informed voters to emulate the behavior of relatively well informed voters. This finding is suggestive of the conditions under which voters who lack encyclopedic information about the content of electoral debates can nevertheless use information shortcuts to vote as though they were well informed.},

  comment   = {overview:
- badly informed voters can use information shortcuts to emulate the behavior of relatively well informed voters
- use positions of groups (in this case insurance industry) to deduce own interests, even though voters lack encyclopedic knowledge

study:
- exit poll of California referendum on car insurance reform
- 339 voters in survey, stated their decision as well as level of information etc.

main results:
- encyclopedic knowledge as well as information shortcuts (especially knowledge of insurance industry's position) affected decision
- knowledge and shortcuts affected choice in the same direction
- effect of shotcut decreased with increasing encyclopedic knowledge
- badly informed voters who had shortcuts were more similar to informed voters than to uninformed voters without shortcuts

comments/questions:
- voters received some information in the exit poll, could this have altered what they reported? -> same info as on the ballot, but maybe more attention?
- paper assumes that signals are true etc.
- Lupia's theory cannot account for quality of signal etc.

Background: Heuristics again. Converse 1964 voters don’t know anything. 
The Theory: The idea of signaling and signaling games.
The Question: Is it really so bad for voters to not know much/use heuristics? Or what happens when the past and partisan cues are missing? Are there other heuristics?
The Method: California exit poll strategy about 5 insurance reform issues (i.e. a complicated topic people are not likely to know much about). As noted did not have party cues or the past as a cue, but did have summaries of the proposals available, state distributed information, the campaigns by each of the interest groups, 
Findings: People who could identity where the insurance company’s position was, could generally “vote correctly.” 
Critical Thoughts: It’s a pretty unique situation, but it does provide evidence that heuristics/shortcuts are at work even in complicated situations and where there are no partisan cues. It has a lot of normative implications/is relatively optimistic about the voter’s ability to make the best decisions for themselves. The sample is limited in many ways – it’s in California, it’s an exit poll. If there is something different about the people in California or the people actually turning out to vote (it wasn’t only a vote on the policies though) it could threaten the implications.},

- argues for coding open-ended responses according to the number of dimensions raised by the respondents
- American public is not very sophisticated

3 dimensions of political sophistication (variations of political belief systems [pbs]):
- size: number of cognitions -> length of response, count of questions answered
- range: dispersion of cognition over categories -> overall variability of topics
- constraint: extent to which the cognitions are interconnected -> variability of topics between items?
-> "Sophistication is the conjunction of these dimensions. A person is  politically sophisticated to the extent to which his or her PBS is large, wide-ranging, and highly constrained." [860]
-> constraint is not equal to consistency!

measures of political sophistication (some of these are argued to be problematic):
- consistency: correltation b/w policy attitudes, correlations with ideological self-locations, entropy measures, corrected correlations, ...
- abstraction: self-locations on ideological dimensions, active use of abstract concepts (AU, considers abstractness of concepts used in evaluation, eg OE response), recognition and understanding (RU, correct ideological placement of parties)
- information holding

The data collection is unique in providing extensive information on the issue positions of all parties with potential for achieving representation in the parliament. Results suggest that the directional theory provides a better description of the relationship. Consistent with directional theory, we find that when parties occupy a centrist position on an issue they are not evaluated on the basis of that issue. Voters neither love nor hate a party in the middle. Thus, in order to build support on the basis of issues, parties must offer some strong stands.},

We consider two models of mass-elite linkage: the traditional spatial model, which conceives of issues as continua of policy options, and the directional model, which conceives of issues as simple dichotomies. The traditional model is more cognitively demanding and is the implicit model of journalists and political elites. We would expect, therefore, that better educated and more politically involved voters would rely on it, while less sophisticated voters would follow the directional paradigm. We investigate this hypothesis with survey data from the 1988 presidential election in the United States and the 1989 parliamentary election in Norway. The results show that at all levels of sophistication and in both countries, voters generally follow the directional model.},

When the theories have been compared on each of these criteria, the results have favored directional theory. Westholm's defense of the proximity model relies on replacing the formal models he purports to be testing with analytic models that incorporate subjective party placements. Subjective placements violate the assumptions of both theories and are known to have a proximity bias. Further, Westholm focuses exclusively on predictions of choice, rejecting other grounds for comparing the theories. In our response, we show that the test Westholm devises does not put proximity theory at risk. Even in an entirely directional world, a world in which proximity theory is irrelevant to behavior, Westholm's test will still favor the proximity model. The fact that Westholm pays homage to the idea of falsifiability, and yet produces only this evidence in support of the proximity model, testifies to the power of directional theory for explaining this Norwegian case, and to the gulf between rhetoric and reality in Westholm's defense.},

We examine how informant selection and post-survey response aggregation influence the validity and reliability of measures built from informant observations. We draw upon three surveys with parallel survey questions of candidate characteristics to examine the trade-off between expanding the size of the local informant pool and the pool's level of expertise. We find that a "wisdom-of-crowds" effect trumps the benefits associated with the expertise of individual informants when the size of the rater pool is modestly increased. We demonstrate that the benefits of expertise are best realized by prescreening potential informants for expertise rather than post-survey weighting by expertise.},

Look at state legislators ambition to move to the US House. 

Professionalism of the state legislature – professional legistlatures attract skilled campaigners and career-oriented politicians leading to more ambitious people – but offset by the relatively desirable post in the professional legislature. For the decision to run, they should be more strategic so only more likely to run if they have a good chance of winning. 
Ambition affected by age, family cost index, future chances of winning, relative value of house seat. Legislative professionalism has no direct effect, but it does have a substantial indirect effect by increasing the preceding variables.},

study/analysis:
- targeted sampling of individuals who are affected by visa policies for immigrants to work in high-technology sector
- measure implicit as well as explicit attitudes towards immigrants

main results:
- opposition to immigration is larger among individuals who are affected by labor-market competition
- results not driven by cultural considerations since implicit attitudes among the subgroup do not deviate from others
- effect of employment in the competyed sector remains among individuals who score low oin the measure of cultural threat
- immigration opposition was not shared among other skilled individuals who were not affected by labor competition
- economic threat did not lead to more general opposition towards imigrants (no spillover)

questions/comments:
- authors discuss to what extent it is problematic that the targeted sampling works in favor of the hypothesized relationship
- what about individuals who do not have a job? blame instead of actual threat?
- cultural threat as rationalization of economic threat?
- measuring cultural threat with IAT is problematic, implicit attitude could also be affected by economic threat...},

- overview of dictionary compression techniques, focuses on lossless compression (as compared to lossy compression, e.g. stemming, case folding, stop word elimination)
- rule of 30: 30 most common words account for 30% of tokens in text
- Heaps' law: estimates vocabulary size as a function of collection size -> linear in log-log space
- Zipf's law: frequency of term decreases rapidly by rank -> follows power law (2nd most common word has 1/2 frequency of most common word, 3rd most common word has 1/3 frequency etc.)
- discussion of dictionary compression is rather basic and technical, not really necessary for my purposes

CHAPTER 6:
- tf-idf weight: term frequency X inverse document frequency
- vector space model: each document is represented as a vector where each element corresponds to the tf-idf weight for each term in a dictionary
- cosine similarity of vector space representations can be used to create a measure of similarity between dictionary and document -> this can be very useful for the MFT paper!
- mentions some alternatives to tf and idf, more details in later chapters I think

  comment   = {Marcus & MacKuen 1993, Anxiety, enthusiasm, and the Vote:
- Overview: Affective intelligence
- They propose a dual-process model of how people approach politics, in particular political messages. 
- Although people experience a mix of emotions, they dichotomize these emotions as either enthusiasm or anxiety. 
 -> Enthusiasm are not part of a continuum, but represent separate dimensions.
- Enthusiasm governs people’s degree of political involvement and interest. 
- Anxiety makes people more conscientious and requires them to pay more attention to political messages. ‘Enthusiasm increases campaign involvement and anxiety increases learning’. 
 -> Enthusiasm, but not anxiety predicts vote choice
 -> A rise in anxiety decreases the reliance on partisanship in vote choice.
 -> Data: 1980 NES, looking at change in political knowledge due to emotions
 -> Anxiety predicts learning over 10 month period; enthusiasm (but not anxiety) predicts interest in the campaign as the election gets closer (but not in the earlier months)
- The important message from this study is that rational choice is conditional on emotional state. Also, this dual-model has implications for how politicians communication with voters because fear/anxiety can make inattentive voters seek information and enthusiasm can make unmotivated voters more active. 
- Note: The authors don’t say that these are the only two emotions that are elicited by politics, rather they argue that on the whole they make up two broad categories of emotion (i.e., enthusiasm can encompass joy, happiness, etc).
- Criticisms: can’t measure anxiety directly: relies on measures like: afraid, uneasy, anger, disgust. Measures enthusiasm as: pride, hope and sympathy
 -> Also, it’s likely that too much anxiety eventually starts to inhibit learning (ie, there’s a curvilinear relationship)
- Links to other literature: the affective intelligence argument isn’t completely at odds with Chuck and Milt’s work, but there are some differences. Chuck and Milt would argue that emotions are primarily about valence (positive/negative) whereas Marcus would argue that discrete emotions have distinct effects. Chuck says the responses to emotions survey items are likely just rationalizations that follow basic valenced affect.},

We then consider the effect of the Court's ideological position on the level of support it enjoys. In contrast to previous research, we take into account that both the Court's and the public's ideological preferences vary over time. Our analysis indicates that the public's appraisal of the Supreme Court responds not to the Court's ideological position per se, but rather to the extent to which the Court's position diverges from the ideological preferences of the citizenry; when the Court deviates from the public mood, its support erodes},

When social polarization is separated from issue position polarization, both sides of the polarization debate can be simultaneously correct. Social polarization, characterized by increased levels of partisan bias, activism, and anger, is increasing, driven by partisan identity and political identity alignment, and does not require the same magnitude of issue position polarization. The partisan-ideological sorting that has occurred in recent decades has caused the nation as a whole to hold more aligned political identities, which has strengthened partisan identity and the activism, bias, and anger that result from strong identities, even though issue positions have not undergone the same degree of polarization. The result is a nation that agrees on many things but is bitterly divided nonetheless. An examination of ANES data finds strong support for these hypotheses.},
  comment   = {overview:
- social polarization (increased partisan bias, activism, anger) vs. issue polarization
- social polarization is driven by partisan identity and political identity alignment, does not require the same magnitude of issue polarization
- partisan-ideological sorting -> aligned political identities -> activism, bias, anger
- issue polarization is not as strong

hypotheses:
1) Partisan-ideological sorting increases political bias, activism, and anger on an individual level, both via partisan strength and independently of partisan strength, even when issue positions are moderate.
2) The effect of sorting on social polarization is greater than its effect on issue extremity

data/analyses:
- ANES cumulative data set
- measure of partisan-ideological sorting: |pid - ideology| * |pid-4| * |ideology-4| = sqrt((pid-ideo)^2 * sqrt((pid-4)^2) * sqrt((ideo-4)^2) = sqrt((pid-ideo)^2 * (pid-4)^2 * (ideo-4)^2) = sqrt[pid^2-2pidideo+ideo^2]
- sorting had an effect even after controlling for issue extremity
- sorting increased social polarization even after controlling for partisan identity (and holding it constant)

questions/comments:
- where does partisan-ideological sorting come from?
- discuss sorting measure -> it's individual partisan sorting rather than aggregate level sorting
- measure of sorting mixes partisan and ideological identity
- partisan alignment does not require issue extremity, but what about issue alignment?
- differentiation b/w ideological issue position and identity is not really clear
- potential mechanism: partisan identity lower for individuals with extreme policy views
- effect of sorting beyond partisan identity is kind of strange since both measures are so interrelated},

- Research Question: What drives Congress member behavior?
- congressmen behave rationally, but policies can matter as well: getting reelected is their first and foremost concern
- doesn't really leave room for the party 
-> individual congressmen are decisive units, looking at more aggregate structures (parties as analytical units) doesn't go very far 
-> obviously, this view is not really supported by current developments -> stronger party cohesion 
- '70s/'80s: democrats/republicacs more often deviated from party line

- only the constituencies are decisive for the cost/benefit analyses of members of congress 
- all the strings that matter are held by the electorate 
-> party doesn't have any leverage

- today: larger ideological homogeneity leads to stronger party consistency, but Mayhew argues that the potential for actual party pressure is still minimal (from foreword of newer edition)

from Carson et al.: "Mayhew (1974) maintains that incumbents are extremely sensitive to the potential electoral implications of their votes, and as a result, behave strategically when announcing a position on a roll-call vote."},

- sample: politically active christians (engaged in church etc.) 
- method: manual coding of open interviews, correlational analyses

empirical test of 2 theories (and respective themes that were coded):

1) implicit family metaphors (Lakoff): rules-reinforcements, self-discipline, nurturant caregiving, empathy-openness 
2) moral intuitions (Haidt): harm-care, fariness-reciprocity, in-group-loyalty, authority-respect, purity-sanctity

results: 
1) family metaphors: 
- conservatives: authority figures as strict enforcers of moral rules, identify lessons in self-discipline 
- liberals: more focus on empathy and openness, but: no more likely than conservatives to describe nurturant authority figures

2) moral intuitions: 
- conservatives: respect for social hierarchy, allegiance to in-groups, and the purity or sanctity of the self 
- liberals: harm and fairness.

=> "Both theories received strong support, although Lakoffï¿½s (2002) prediction that liberals should depict authority figures in their lives as nurturant caregivers was not supported." 
-> overall, strong support with some slight reservations...

question: 
- how problematic is the sample? 
- what about the causal direction? the results are purely correlational

- interesting gender effect, is it due to ideology or might there be other confounding factors? 
- why didn't they include every theme in the equations simultaneoously?

- in how far can this approach provide solid support for the causal story of the models? important influence of interpretation!},

I report the results of a simulation in which the amount of random measurement error is varied, to demonstrate the importance of estimating measurement error models and the superiority that Kalman filtering has over regression. I use the model in a substantive example to examine the effects of public opinion regarding nuclear power on the enforcement decisions of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I then estimate a dynamic linear errors-in-variables model using multiple indicators for the latent variables and compare simulations of this model to the single indicator model. Finally, I provide substantive examples which examine the effect of people's economic expectations on their approval of the president and their approval of government more generally.},

- constitutional norms did not affect the the use of presidential vetoes prior to 1829 
- electoral circumstances determine veto policies: conditions for blame game vetoes 
- partisan competition before a broad electorate had yet to fully emerge in the early periods
-> early veto usage was lower because the electoral conditions that generate equilibrium vetoes had yet to emerge

Findings and contribution:
Veto's play an important role in bargaining between the president and Congress. Congress can make concessions to obtain a signature and achieve some policy gains, or it can write an unacceptable bill that the president will veto (if this will make the pres look bad). Veto use in the early 19th century increased because the gains from making the president look bad increased. These changes resulted from the emergence of parties and the increase in mass parties.},

  comment   = {review paper looking at the consequences of experiential openness
- one if the big five personality dimensions 
- definition: "the breadth, depth, and permeability of consciousness, and in the recurrent need to enlarge and examine experience" -> intrapsychic
- related constructs: need for cognition, xenophilia, tough-mindedness
-> personality traits affect social interactions in various domains

macrosocial influences: 
- cultural innovation 
- political ideology: liberalism and conservatism -> "variations in experiential Openness are the major psychological determinant of political polarities" 
- authoritarianism -> openness an indespensable element in the explanation, psychological vs. political/social construct -> similarities, maybe alternative measurement/concept? 
- attitude formation and political affiliation -> need for cognitive closure etc.

microsocial influences: 
- marriage and family -> interesting overlap with Lakoff's family metaphor argument 
- friendships and social relations 
- interpersonal processes and dyadic interactions

origins of openness: 
- parent-child relations -> weak effects 
- strong evidence for heritability -> "Openness variables showed 'the largest estimates for additive genetic variance... of any of the Big Five'" 
- strong stability in adulthood -> underscores it's status as a dimension of personality -> predisposes individuals to develop liberal or conservative views

relevance for social sciences: 
- breath of the construct 
- methodological benefits: well-validated measures

summary:
- Openness to new experience is related many different behaviors and atttidues including politics.
- Since openness is heritable it would be incorrect to idenitify it with the liberal conservative dimension of attitudes. Instaed it predisposes people to develop these attitudes. It must be incorporated into attitude change models and research.
- Openness to new experience leads to “different ways of approach and processing experience lead to different value systems that exercise a profound effect on social interactions.”

questions 
- this argument lacks a mechanism / motivational underpinning 
- no clear conceptual distinction from e.g. authoritarianism -> but: for A, there is more theoretical reasoning about motivational underpinnings etc. 
- I would argue that the concept's breath is actually problematic since it doesn't allow for a clear distinction from other concepts -> blurry line, overlapping concepts as explanations},

-> Big Five, Five Factor Model (FFM), basic dimensions of personality
- 2 research traditions: lexical tradition, natural language adjectives + personality questionnaires
-> recent evidenceshowed correspondence between lexical factors and traits measured by personality questionnaires

objections and responses:
- too few factors -> but: no consistent evidence on additional factor
- too many factors -> but approaches to reduce factors are not consistent

- ratings vs. self-reports -> social reputation vs inner dispositions

- cognitive artifacts vs. realistic description -> FFM as projection of cognitive biases onto the targets people rate

conceptualization of factors: 
- descriptive / factor definitions -> description of debates about meaning of individual factors 
- theoretical / explanation of dimensions etc. -> factors point to universal issues, FFM is a version of trait theory

agenda for theorizing: 
- What is to be explained? 
- Psychophysiological theories 
- Evolutionary perspectives and behavior genetics: argues a little bit against evolutionary perspective, since it describes differences between species rather than within species -> c.f. Haidt's moral foundation argument 
- Developmental theories 
- Dynamic and interpersonal theories

=> "The appeal of the model is threefold: It integrates a wide array of personality constructs, thus facilitating communication among researchers of many different orientations; it is comprehensive, giving a basis for systematic exploration of the relations between personality and other phenomena; and it is efficient, providing at least a global description of personality with as few as five scores"

interesting thought (p.203): 
"Although differences in standing on the five factors may not have adaptive significance, there are adaptive advantages in being able to detect these individual differences in others"
-> identification of factors rather than the factors themselves might have adaptive advantage!},

- Prospectors are most advantaged and evolve when the environment is such that it always keeps them close to the threshold of survival
- Generally the bold always outperform them in poor environments and the meek do in good environments. Meek do well in abundant environment, bold in scarce environment, but shifting environmental conditions or uncertain ones advantage prospectors
- Fitness increases are the best explanation for why we behave in such a manner
- Suggest that prospect theory could be applied to American voting spatial models, but this really just wants to flip the script to address from risk aversion to risk seeking behavior may not really incorporate in the reference point
- Also tap into conflict IR as a place where things could be applied
- Economic development and comparative politics is another place where prospect theory could be applied

- An evolutionary model that provides a parsimonious explanation for why individual may posses hardwired tendencies to make choices consistent with the predictions of prospect theory.
- Asymmetry in the hedonic experience of positive and negative makes evolutionary sense since few positive experiences outside of reproduction and eating offer fitness advantage.
- Risk-sensitive optimal foraging theory 
 - Old theories of animal foraging assumed that animals always wanted the highest expected utility, independent of variance 
 - But high variance strategies can lead to times of starvation.
 - When starving, people will take the high variance landscape because they need a high-payoff to survive – so they are risk-averse when starving. 
 - There is always a need to obtain a fixed payoff threshold
 - The marginal benefit of gains and cost of less is decreasing in size as the number of meals increases.
 - Different types of people – meek and bold, the best survigin strategy is one that switches depending on the environment – when resources scarce, when resources abundant meek. – prospectors change according to predictions of prospect theory.
- Conflict models in IR – the context of the situation is very important to determine how someone will react – Are they in scarcity or abundance?
- Models of economic development and reform – when will people accept harsh risky economic reforms - when they are in scarcity and must take a risky choice.},

Unlike the dyad ratios approach, the model developed here is derived from an explicit model of individual behavior-the widely used item response theory model.

An experiment was designed to address three questions: What are the relationships between ambivalence and uncertainty? What are the informational foundations of subjective ambivalence and uncertainty, and to what extent are they rooted in on-line (time of exposure) and memory-based (time of judgment) processes? What are the consequences of ambivalence and uncertainty for candidate evaluation? The results suggest that (1) subjective uncertainty is more strongly rooted in information about the candidate than is subjective ambivalence; (2) subjective uncertainty and (to a lesser extent) ambivalence are associated with an increased propensity to engage in memory-based processing; and (3) subjective ambivalence and uncertainty result in more negative evaluations, particularly among less sophisticated people.

  comment   = {overview:
- When suspicious, individuals possess greater concern for judgment accuracy which leads to more effortful cognitive processing and tolerance of uncertainty. Individuals’ trait appraisals of the speaker will reflect this uncertainty, and result in a negative overall evaluation. However, this process will only occur amongst those individuals who disagree with the speaker’s expressed position, since individuals tend to accept attitudinally congruent information at face value. Suspicion-based cognitive activity moderated by level of agreement w/message

Experimental 2x3 b/t subjects design 
- Speaker’s occupation, audience match on issue manipulated
- Measured suspicion, policy disagreement, cognitive activity, uncertainty & evaluation

Results
- Greater suspicion & uncertain when congressman condition, strong interaction effect for congruent audience match condition
- When labeled congressman, policy disagreement, suspicion, and uncertainty associated w/negative character trait evals and thermometer ratings
-> Representation/categorization of objects w/specific traits effects emotional reactions, cognitive processing, and downstream evals of object.

Take-away:
- Categorization is moderated by individuals’ accuracy & directional based goals, which are biased in nature. Thus, viewing politician as “suspicious,” “pandering” or as possessing negative traits may be an individual’s way of rationalizing the difference b/t their position and politician’s position as motivated by accuracy goal.

==========================================================================

Research questions:
1. What factors cause us to experience suspicion?
2. What is the link between suspicion and uncertainty?
3. What impact do suspicion and uncertainty have on evaluations of public officials?

Cognitive implications of suspicion:
1. When we are suspicious, we evaluate information negatively and experience negative affect -> more systematic processing
2. Agreement/Positively evaluated information and positive affect -> less systematic processing

Set up/methods:
Non-student sample. Gave them 1 of 6 versions of a newspaper article about a guy giving a public speech about gun control. Some situations had the speaker as being congruent with the audience opinion on gun control, some situations had him as incongruent with the audience opinion.
Design: 2 (role of speaker: Congressman or school teacher) X 3 (Audience match: congruent, incongruent or control). Under what conditions will the speaker be seen as pandering and what effect will this have?

Biggest findings:
1. Just being a politician makes people more suspicious
2. Suspicion went up with the politician’s message was congruent with the audience
3. Opposition to what the speaker is saying isn’t enough to produce suspicion. Opposition to the speech IN COMBINATION with suspect conditions (he’s agreeing with audience ie. pandering) is what creates suspicion. 
4. Cognitive findings: The measure of cognitive activity is the amount of recall:
a. People who disagreed with the speech/statement remembered more
b. Highest level of recall? When people disagreed with politician when in suspect circumstances (when he pandering/agreeing with the audience)
5. Trait uncertainty findings: More uncertainty about politician than teacher. Also more uncertainty when his speech was congruent with the audience (pandering). More uncertainty when subject disagreed with him. More uncertainty from the politically knowledgeable. 
6. When people disagreed with speaker, were suspicious and were uncertain, it was associated with overall negative evaluations of the target.},

These experiments are designed to test: (1) Riker and Brams' controversial hypothesis that vote trading can yield inferior outcomes as against the alternative hypothesis that vote trading induces ï¿½market-likeï¿½ efficiency in voting bodies; (2) the relative adequacy of several game theoretic solution concepts for vote trading games without a Condorcet winner (core); and, (3) the adequacy of the core itself.
First, on the basis of eighteen experiments with binding commitments, we find some support for Riker and Brams' hypothesis: in nine trials, subjects first trade to a Pareto dominated outcome. In five of these trials, however, these outcomes are eventually displaced by Pareto efficient ones. Without binding commitments, however, we find little support for the ï¿½paradox of vote tradingï¿½ hypothesis. Specifically, while six of seven trials of a 3-person game yield ï¿½equitableï¿½ outcomes, seventeen trials of several 5-person games without binding commitments strongly support the competitive solution as a cooperative game solution concept, and suggest that the V-set and M 1 bargaining set are either redundant or useless. Seven trials each of six 5-person games with a condorcet winner (core), however, suggest that usual static solution concepts may be inadequate for treating games with any interesting degree of strategic complexity.},

Specifically, these experiments show that if a simple majority voting game possesses a Core point--a point that cannot be defeated by a majority vote--subjects choose outcomes at or near this point. In this article, however, we present some additional experimental evidence to suggest that committee choice in simple majority rule games is not dictated solely by whether or not the core is nonempty. We conclude that, in the experimental context of open and free discussion, the performance of the core may be affected by the structure of the alternative space, and by factors that seem irrelevant to the theory, such as the structure of the dominance relation underlying the core in the social ordering.},

Theoretically, this induces a stable equilibrium at the issue-by-issue median preference and precludes the instabilities associated with unconstrained majority rule. By varying the ease with which subjects can communicate and thereby circumvent this procedure, we gain in-sight into the way in which people might circumvent political institutions that otherwise induce equilibria or that are designed to bias outcomes away from results that might prevail in an unconstrained context.},

  comment   = {- introduction of models / estimation techniques used for twin studies
- c.f. analysis of variance and latent variable models
- example: 50% heritability -> 50% of the variance across people in the sample, that is accounted for by genetic factors
-> estimate of heritability is the fraction of variability in the sample

- estimates cannot be generalized from the sample, since they are determined by the variance (!) in the sample (+ no random sample)
-> quantity describes a particular sample at a particular point in time

- most modern literature uses confidence intervals rather than significance tests
-> statistical significance problematic since there is no population to generalize to (no rejection of H0)

some important definitions:
- shared environment (C): anything in the environment that makes twins similar (-> check formula again! what does it mean exacty?)
- unshared environment (E): anything in the environment that makes twins on their trait dissimilar of each other -> residual, also includes any measurement error in the phenotype

- monozygotic twins: same egg, same sperm, share 100\% of genes
- dizygotic twins: different egg, different sperm, share on average 50\% of genes

- additive genetic component: effects of genes are added, correlation b/w DZ twins is expected to be half of MZ twins 
- nonadditive/dominance genetic variance: interaction within/between genes -> c.f. for example recessive genes
-> both have no effect on within MZ correlation, but they do on DZ twins -> dominance leads to stronger dissimilarity in DZ twins
-> if DZ twin correlation is significantly lower than 2*rMZ, there is nonadditive/dominance genetic effect
-> shared environment component cannot be estimated if nonadditive genetic effect is apparent

adoption study:
- advantage: there is no shared environment
- it would be perfect if environments were determined at random and the phenotypes of biological and adoptive parents was measured -> unlikely
- overall, adoption studies become more and more difficult

estimation of ACE model (A: genetics, C: common environment, E: unique environment) based on twin records
- identification assumptions: corr(A1,A2)=1|0.5; corr(C1,C2)=1; E1 and E2 are essentially residuals
- A: similarity b/w monozygotic twins, anything that makes MZ correlation twice as high as DZ correlation
- C: similarity b/w bizygotic twins, anything that makes MZ correlation the same as DZ correlation
- E: anything else
-> equal environments assumption -> if this assumption does not hold, we overestimate heritability
-> assortative mating -> random mating on the trait -> if this assumption does not hold, the .5 correlation assumption for DZ twins does not hold anymore -> underestimates heritability;
- there is some assortative mating with regard to openness to experience!

gene environment correlation:
- genes predispose you to select certain environments to be in -> potentially very important, how direct is the mechanism b/w genes and political beliefs/behavior
- overestimates heritability!},

We focus in particular on votersï¿½ ability to form differentiated expectations about possible coalitions, the likelihood of a majority and the likelihood that the parties will be able to agree on a coalition. We report the results of a nationally representative survey conducted before the 2006 Austrian General Election. We collected detailed information about respondents' party and coalition preferences and expectations about the electoral outcomes. Green Party voters are used to demonstrate that the effect of coalition preferences depends on whether or not voters expect a coalition to succeed.},

It is unclear whether it can explain strategic voting behavior in a fairly common type of political system, multi-party systems with proportional representation, minimum vote thresholds, and coalition governments. In this paper, we develop a (non-formal) strategic voting game and show in a simulation that the model produces election scenarios and outcomes with desirable characteristics. We then test the decision-theoretic model in a laboratory experiment. Participants with a purely instrumental (financial) motivation voted in a series of 25 independent elections.

The results show that voters are frequently able to make optimal or strategic vote decisions, but that voters also rely on simple decision heuristics and are highly susceptible to coalition signals by parties.},

  abstract  = {Polls and coalition signals can help strategic voters in multiparty systems with proportional representation and coalition governments to optimise their vote decision. Using a laboratory experiment embedded in two real election campaigns, this study focuses on voters' attention to and perception of polls and coalition signals. The manipulation of polls and coalition signals allows a causal test of their influence on strategic voting in a realistic environment. The findings suggest that active information acquisition to form fairly accurate perceptions of election outcomes can compensate for the advantage of high political sophistication. The theory of strategic voting is supported by the evidence, but only for a small number of voters. Most insincere vote decisions are explained by other factors. Thus, the common practice to consider all insincere voters as strategic is misleading.

If there are possibly decisive advantages to be gained from striking the first blow, both temptation and fear may shortcut efforts to resolve a conflict in less costly ways, and trigger massive violence. Theoretical work and case studies suggest that in ethnic conflicts intermingled settlement patterns give rise to such first-strike advantages. I test whether ethnic groups in conflict are more likely to become involved in ethnic warfare if their main region of settlement is ethnically diverse. I also include controls intended to capture other aspects of the security dilemma. In robustness tests, I add indicators of group concentration and local majority status that have been found to increase the risk of ethnic violence in previous quantitative studies. I find a strong, statistically significant association between regional ethnic diversity and ethnic warfare.},

- implicit racial cues allowed the republican campaign (Bush 1988) to activate racial thinking while not openly raising racial issues -> against norm of equality etc.
- racial cues are therefore only effective if they are implicit (and not recognized by the audience), they loose their effect as soon as they become explicit and overt

chapter 5:
- description of media coverage of William Horton case in the context of the 1988 US presidential election
- Republicans used the case to make a point that Dukakis is weak on crime, but the campaign had implicit racial appeals
- phases of media coverage: low intensity implicit, high intensity implicit, explicit phase, post-election
- in the implicit phase, the racial aspect was not openly mentioned
- in the explicit phase, racial appeals were picked up
- media did not pick up racial aspect, even after it as made explicit (they were skeptical that it was about race), only after the election, media consensus converged to viewing the issue as racial

chapter 6:
- investigates impact of explicit and implicit appeals
- effect of resentment peaks during implicit period: implicit appeals primed racial predispositions, effects disappeared as soon as the appeals became explicit
- implicit or explicit messages did not affect the influence of being worried about crime on candidate evaluation etc. -> so the claim that it was about crime and not race is wrong
- effect of conservatism peaked when the coverage turned explicitly racial (why?)

experimental design:
- group discussion of 5 participants (0-5 women) + unanimous vs. majority rule -> 6 X 2
- goal: set the most just principle of redistribution and set a poverty line (which applied to themselves in the experiment but could hypothetically apply to society as a whole)
- average discussion: 25 minutes
- measures: manual coding of positive/negative interruptions, elaborate interjections, rating of influence (others + self)

  comment   = {overview:
- argumentative theory of reasoning (an evolutionary psychological theory of reasoning): individual reasoning mechanisms work best when used to produce and evaluate arguments during a public deliberation
- main predictions: group reasoning outperforms individual reasoning if diverse opinions  are discussed, but confirmation bias leads to polarization and attitude reinforcement when people reason alone or with like-minded peers
- evolutionary theory -> "we can proceed to specify the conditions in which reasoning should be conducive to good performance and those that will lead to poor outcomes"
- function of reasoning is to produce epistemic improvment through deliberation -> normal conditions for reasoning is an actual or a potential deliberation
- definition of deliberation: "An activity is deliberative to the extent that reasoning is used to gather and evaluate arguments for and against a given proposition.” -> private vs. public deliberation
- "the function of reasoning is not the betterment of beliefs and judgments through private ratiocination, and this is why reasoning does not accomplish this task well. According to the theory that will be defended here, the function of reasoning is social. More speciﬁcally it is argumentative, i.e., it is to enable individuals to argue with each other."
- epistemic vigilance: cognitive mechanisms to evaluate communicated information
- "The argumentative theory predicts that reasoning should yield good results when used in its normal conditions—in an actual or a potential deliberation. The data reviewed here conﬁrms this prediction."
- abnormal conditions: reasoning alone or reasoning with like-minded people -> strong confirmation bias leads to polarization etc.

questions/comments:
- cites some good examples for potential experimental designs (check p. 249)
- great argument for the role of social interaction as a delivery method for corrective information in the conclusion: "fixing individual reasoning is not the solution [...] But what the results presented above show is that trying to eradicate the conﬁrmation bias at the individual level is very difﬁcult (Ritchart & Perkins, 2005; Willingham, 2008), while it can easily be harnessed to yield good outcomes at the collective level."

I consider theoretical arguments about how public social programs might affect civic involvement and advance a policy feedback approach that assesses both resource and interpretive effects of policy design. Newly collected survey and interview data permit the examination of several hypotheses. The analysis reveals that the G.I. Bill produced increased levels of participation-by more fully incorporating citizens, especially those from less privileged backgrounds, through enhancement of their civic capacity and predisposition for involvement. The theoretical framework offered here can be used to evaluate how other public programs affect citizens' participation in public life.},

First, MSS's findings hold using rainfall levels as instruments. Second, Ciccone (2011) does not provide theoretical justification for preferring rainfall levels. Third, the first-stage relationship between rainfall and growth is weaker after 2000, suggesting that alternative instruments are needed when studying recent conflicts.

  comment   = {overview:
- policy preferences consituency -> roll call of parliamentarian?
- two mechanisms: constituency's attitude -> representative's attitude -> roll call behavio & constituency's attitude -> perception of constituency's attitude -> roll call behavior
- additional mechanism: representatives move the constituency
- consituency can control policy actions by electing representative with similar attitudes, or by putting pressure on an representative who is in office (re-election)
- looks at three fields: social welfare, civil rights of african american, american involvement in foreign affairs
- fields differ in their potential for consituency control, as well as in the mechanisms through which constituency can control representatives
-> civil rights shows high influence through perception, social welfare influence through own attitude

3 types of representational arguments:
1) Burke's idea: representing interests rather than direct will
2) delegation: direct representation, like direct democracy
3) responsible party government: party out out an ideological platform that people can decide on

necessary condition for constituency influence:
- representative's votes must agree with his own views
- attitudes or perceptions must correspond to the preferences of constituency (at least imperfectly)
- constituency must take into account policy views of candidates when choosing a representative -> this one could be problematic given the level of information
- but: citizens lack information, are uncertain about policy positions

questions / comments:
- topics concerns federal rather than district level
- problem of endogeneity
- district level opinion is generated by aggregating nationally representative survey (ANES), which is not designed to be representative on the district level -> measure of constituency attitude is wrong!},

The experimental scenario dealt with a decision problem in the area of counterterrorism. The authors found that while more than one-third of students recommended doing nothing, the overwhelming majority of military officers (more than 90 percent) recommended doing something. Also, military officers exhibited less maximizing and more satisfacing decision making than students. The results show that relying on experiments with students "playing" the role of real-world national security policy makers may bias the results. The two groups are, in fact, very different. Based on student samples, it is possible to accept propositions that would not be found with samples of elite decision makers and reject propositions that may be right. However, it is possible that students can be assigned to experiments where they represent the "public" and not elites.},

reasons for divergence b/w lab and field (see paper for more details):
- participant characteristics
- guiding design principles (mundane realism etc.)
- timing of research
- generalizability of processes / phenomena

main results:
- high correspondence b/w lab and field results
- but: nontrivial number of effects reversed b/w lab and field

external validity of subfields:
- industrial-organizational psych high
- social psych most frequently changed signs between lab and field

=> "Many psychological results found in the laboratory can be replicated in the field, but the effects often differ greatly in their size and less often (though still with disappointing frequency) differ in their directions"},

  comment   = {overview:
- discusses 2 issues related to the measurement of political knowledge: survey protocol & item format
- encouraging "don't knows" (DK) and open-ended items are problematic -> choice of knowledge measure affects hypothesis testing
- 1) problems related to the encouragement of DK: response set / propensity to guess -> some uninformed respondents might be more likely to guess (inflate knowledge score) while others who know the answer say they don't know because they are not certain (deflating scores)
- 2) problems related to open-ended items: DKs cannot be eliminated, understanding of abstract concepts cannot be tested, subjective scoring of responses is problematic (especially with regard to partially correct answers)
-> political knowledge should be measured using closed items that discourage DKs and offer about 3 answer categories

study/results:
- split ballot test on 1998 NES pilot + survey in the Tallahassee metropolitan area
- discouraging DKs in the instructions/question wording reduced the DK rate and eliminates the problem of differential propensity to guess
- post-hoc corretion of DKs: randomly assigning DKs to the answer categories
- proposed item format does not increase survey length and does not affect survey rapport
- discouraging DKs increases validity of knowledge scores but reduces reliability (however, reduction in reliability is argued to be less severe)
- discouraging DKs reveals stronger knowlegde interaction effects when looking at ideology X knowledge -> feeling thermometer
- results regarding the effect of knowledge on tolerance are mixed

questions/comments:
- argument that random assignment of DK answers in open-ended items is not feasible is not correct
- proposed method increases measurement error which ultimately leads to biased estimates if political knowledge is used as an independent variable},

  comment   = {overview:
- gender gap in political knowledge can be partly attributed to measurement issues (about half of the gap)
- main mechanis: men are systematically more likely to guess than women
- measures of political knowledge should omit don't knows and be based on closed items
- open-ended items are problematic because you can't get rid of DK's

analyses / results:
1) re-analysis of Burns/Schlozman/Verba CPS data:
- gender differences in reliability for multiple choice items
- simulation shows that difference in reliability can account for about half of the gender difference
- greatest deviation from cumulative structure for men on the multiple-choice battery (due to guessing), open-ended items have better goodness-of-fit
- DK rate of women larger than DK rate for men even for issues where women new more
2) experimental data in 1998 NES pilot study:
- study discouraged DKs (the few DKs that did appear were recoded as random choice)
- significant interaction b/w treatment and gender -> gender gap reduced if DK's are discouraged
3) 2000 NES (small additional analysis)
- open-ended with DK encouragement/discouragement
- DK cannot be efficiently discouraged as in closed items, and remaining DK's can't be distributed randomly (really?)

questions / comments:
- omitting DK induces stronger measurement error which might lead to biased estimates
- argument against open items is not really reasonable since open item guess is most likely to be wrong
- why not just imputing random answers for DKs in general?
- it's weird that we see the gender differences in DKs at the end in open-ended responses as well... furthermore, the gender gap seems to be increased if DKs are discouraged....},

- parametric adjustment technique for estimating causal effects -> control vars are not necessarily sufficient to get unbiased causal effects!

-> one major problem for regression models: individual-level heterogeneity of a causal effect
-> describes connection b/w regression and matching and shows when both yield the same outcomes (or not) -> causal effect heterogeneity makes OLS estimate inconsistent for causal effects
-> might allow for an argument for a adjustment of OLS such that it comes closer to average causal effect (?) -> weighting by conditional variance vs. propensity scores... (p.145)
-> see regression as implementation of perfect stratification and matching as weighted regression
-> most matching estimators can be rewritten as forms of nonparametric regression, and OLS can sometimes be seen as a form of matching with conditional variance weightinh
- matching estimator of causal effects
-> p. 155: "Matching may significantly outperform regression models when the true functional form of a regression is nonlinear but a simple linear specification is used mistakenly. However, as shown earlier, the superior performance requires that the propensity score be estimated effectively, and perhaps flawlessly, in the case of weighting estimators."
-> regression can be used to supplement a matching algorithm
-> linearity constraints across causal state (for more than dichotomous cause) are problematic in OLS setting
-> regression specification (to get "true" model) is unclear,

Chapter 6:
- bounds on causal effects without further assumptions! (as long as variables have bounds)

Chapter 7:
- IV estimation
- IMPORTANT: testing whether Z affects Y after conditioning on D is not sufficient to prove/disprove the IV identifying assumption, because D is a collider for Z and U! (196f)

Historically, voting in U.S. presidentialprimaries is sequential, but recentprimaries have been 'front-loaded" into the early weeks of the season. We explore sequential voting in drawn-out primaries and simultaneous voting in front-loaded ones theoretically and use laboratory elections to examine our predictions empirically. We find evidence that in sequential voting later voters can use early outcomes to infer information about candidates and make choices that better reflect their preferences. The ability of later voters to infer information increases with higher levels of risk aversion and information provided on early outcomes. We discover that when a moderate candidate is largely unknown, information aggregation in sequential voting can increase the probability s/he will win, which supports the contention of policymakers that sequential voting can lead to different electoral outcomes.},

-pg. 181 “For over a decade, psychologists have focused on the control and suppression of stereotype use. Several strategies for inhibiting stereotype use have been examined: 1. providing clear and diagnostic counterstereotypical behavior from a member of a stereotyped group that forces perceivers to individuate and attend to stereotype-inconsistent information (e.g., Locksley, Borgida, Brekke, & Hepburn, 1980; Moskowitz, 1996),
2. providing goals (e.g., Fiske & Neuberg, 1990; Jones & Thibaut, 1958; Kruglanski & Freund, 1983; Tetlock, 1985) that serve to similarly promote a movement away from heuristic information processing to systematic evaluations of members of stereotyped groups, and 3. instructing individuals to suppress stereotypic thoughts (e.g., Monteith, Sherman, & Devine, 1998; Macrae, Bodenhausen, et al., 1994). These strategies suggest that control is exerted through effortful processing and the intention to curb one's use of stereotypes after stereotypes have been activated. Our data are not inconsistent with this notion that goals can lead to the effortful debiasing of judgments after the passive activation of a stereotype. Even nonchronics should be able to control stereotyping if they have a goal that promotes elaborate processing. However, our data further demonstrate that stereotype activation can be controlled through goals.”

- Uses experimental paradigm of priming
- They find exposure effect where people like something if they are repeatedly exposed to it and have no prior affect towards object interpreted as framing effect b/c more easily recognizable 
- But people don’t have improved recognition, but they say that they like Chinese ideographs with increased exposures more.
- When process/stimuli affective then substantive effect on liking for primed objects (at suboptimal 4ms exposure); For non-affect prime, latent recognition improved after longer exposure (at optimal 2 sec). “Magnitude of the priming effect was inversely related to the length of exposure to the primes, with only suboptimal exposures producing any significant effects.”
- Takeaway: all objects possess an automatic affective charge, even the ones we may be exposed to for the first time. Cognitive and affective systems may be separable and independent.
- Criticism: This doesn’t work if already have a pre-existing opinion/affect about the specific object – if negative affect pre-existing priming polarizes in negative direction},

theoretical argument:
- parasite stress hypothesis
- behavioral tendency toward obedience and conformity decreases harm of diseases etc. -> behavior as adaptation
- government reflect attitudes and values of individuals, therefore parasite stress should increase authoritarian government
- mediation argument: parasites -> authoritarian values -> authoritarian government

results:
- both studies confirm their hypothesis as well as the mediational argument
- however, I'm not sure whether I trust their results...
- for example, coefficients would be biased if reciprocal argument regardign the relationship b/w governance and values is true

- interaction in heterogeneous network (1) encourages deeper understanding of own viewpoint, (2) produces greater awareness of rationale for opposing viewpoint, (3) contributes to greater tolerance
- mechanisms leading to higher tolerance: cognitive (awareness of rationale behind opposing viewpoint) + affective (intimacy of cross-cutting interactions)

results:
- cross-cutting political networks do not appear to increase awareness of one own's political views
- but it increases awareness of legitimate rationales for opposing views -> exposure to dissonant views, not just political discussion in general -> moderated by civil orientation toward conflict

data/analyses:
- survey: asks respondents to indicate how often they discuss politics with others + self-reported disagreement
- laboratory experiment: manipulation of cross-cutting exposure, perspective-taking ability

comments/questions:
- self-reported disagreement could be problematic, what are the individual understandings of disagreement
- measure of political tolerance could also be problematic
- causality unclear: individuals who are more tolerant might be more likely to discuss politics in a cross-cutting network

- Mutz is an outlier in terms of the conceptualization of (cross-cutting) social networks:
- changes from previous network scholars: directly look at opinion change, investigate positive effect of exposure to variety of opinions},

Analyses show that although the ``used suspects{''} play important roles in explaining political activites. the main culprit is social capital. Among social capital measures, through all are important, associational involvement and social networks, followed by trust and volunteering, are the best predictors of political participation. Moreover, the effect of social capital varies by period of immigration. Theoretical and policy implications of findings are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Does the occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, volcanic eruption, tsunami, flood, hurricane, epidemic, heat wave, and/or plague increase the risk of violent civil conflict in a society? This study uses available data for 187 political units for the period 1950-2000 to systematically explore this question that has received remarkably little attention in the voluminous literature on civil war. We find that natural disasters significantly increase the risk of violent civil conflict both in the short and medium term, specifically in low- and middle-income countries that have intermediate to high levels of inequality, mixed political regimes, and sluggish economic growth. Rapid-onset disasters related to geology and climate pose the highest overall risk, but different dynamics apply to minor as compared to major conflicts. The findings are robust in terms of the use of different dependent and independent variables, and a variety of model specifications. Given the likelihood that rapid climate change will increase the incidence of some types of natural disasters, more attention should be given to mitigating the social and political risks posed by these cataclysmic events.},

- examines how the persuasive power of values-based political messages depends on recipients having (1) shared values with the speaker, (2) shared political party identifications, and (3) expectations of values traditionally being associated with different political parties
- 2x2x2 experiment of persuasive speeches read by college students (N=301): strong/weak x individualistic/egalitarian values x party identity of speaker
- results: value matching promotes close attention to messages, party mismatching increases message rejection
-> moderated by value consistency: participants especially rejected messages from rival party members when the speaker evoked unexpected values

comments:
- garden of forking paths, lots of interactions based on a small sample, only the main effect of argument strength was significant
- argument strength is seen as intersubjective, which might make sense in this specific application, but doesn't make sense in every context},

- The key point of this article is that framing is distinct from simple belief change. In the context of the expectancy value model, wi changes, rather than vi . “Framing effects are not reducible to the new information that the framed message provides. Instead, frames operate by activating information already at the recipients’ disposal” (p. 225).
- Moderately sophisticated individuals are most susceptible to persuasion (changing vi), with high and low sophisticates less susceptible. On the other hand, framing effects (changing wi) should not be dampened among high sophisticates. This is because sophisticated individuals are more likely to have the framed information stored in memory (also see Chong and Druckman 2007 p. 112).
- The authors design an experiment to test whether framing effects differ between those familiar and unfamiliar with a framed message. If attitudes change when one is exposed to an argument they are already familiar with, this would demonstrate a framing effect rather than belief change.
- Results show that, within the high familiarity group, exposure to a relevant frame changed the magnitude of the effect of blame attributions and economic concerns on support for welfare. This is consistent with framing effects.
- Question: Do frames affect only the weights assigned to evaluations, or can they also change held beliefs? Does the experiment in this paper provide a suitable test of this?
- Question: Is distinguishing between framing and priming effects important? Is it feasible empirically?},

  comment   = {main argument:
- big five personality factors can be seen as result of trad-off between fitness costs and benefits
- the optimal value for these trade-offs depends on the context
- therefore, genetic diversity persists

personality variation in humans can be explained by:
1) fluctuating nature of selection + large numbers of genes that can affect behavior
- optimum may vary depending on context -> spatiotemporal variation in selection
- e.g. negative frequency-dependent selection
2) behavioral alternatives can be considered as trade-offs

=> author discusses each of the B5 in terms of the trade-off framework -> argument for personality variation

questions:
- how much is genetic polymorphism and how much is just genetic environment interaction?
- how else should behavior be distributed? normal distribution alone is not a good argument for evolutionary argument
- directional selection does not eliminate pure randomness and mutation
- what about environmental interactions?

- negative frequency-dependent selection
-> relative fitness of a trait is contingent on the mutation's spreadedness
-> in modern human history, humans shape their environment and the personality X environment interaction is inherently endogenous to your social network and their personality traits},

- Research Question: How influential is the President? Where does that influence come from?
- presidential power is the power to persuade, might exceed formal power depending on contextual factors like publicity, clarity etc. + long time horizon!
- but the president's power is also constrained by other executive office-holders
- president has to persuade others that something is in their own interest and not only his

Methods: 
- case study/anecdotal approach. Partly theoretical (though not formal). This work is essential in laying the foundations for research into presidential politics.

Findings:
- The president is not as strong as the public perceives.
- The pluralist nature of politics means the president needs to persuade, rather than command (ie he needs congress to pass laws, executive agencies have to deal with congress/ can ignore him sometimes). 

Sources of presidential power: 
1. Professional reputation: If people believe the president will win, then it is more likely to occur. A history of failure will undermine president. 
2. Prestige: When the public thinks well of the president it will be harder for congress to resist him.
3. President does have some control over a broad range of things (can make appointments, excecutive orders, veto etc.) This gives him a large number of things to bargain with.},

The first is society centred and built on the concepts of social capital, trust and civil society. The second is politics centred and focuses on the performance of government and the economy. The two theories are not necessarily incompatible, but they are usually treated in a mutually exclusive way. In this article they are tested against a combination of aggregate cross-national comparative data and detailed case studies of four countries that have suffered exceptional decline of political support for politicians, political institutions and the systems of government. The puzzle is that cross-national comparative evidence about a large and diverse number of nations supports social capital theory, whereas in-depth study of four countries that have experienced substantial decline of political support does not. The erosion of support coincides in all four with poor economic and/or political performance. A way of reconciling the two theories and their supporting evidence is suggested, arguing that while social capital is a necessary foundation for democratic support, it is not a sufficient cause.},

In contrast, a party leader's endorsement may polarize opinion, inducing out-party identifiers to take a contrary position. Using survey experiments from the 2008 presidential election, I examine whether in- and out-party candidate cues-John McCain and Barack Obama-affected partisan opinion. The results indicate that in-party leader cues do not persuade but that out-party leader cues polarize. This finding holds in an experiment featuring President Bush in which his endorsement did not persuade Republicans but it polarized Democrats. Lastly, I compare the effect of party leader cues to party label cues. The results suggest that politicians, not parties, function as polarizing cues.},

- "suggest that emotional response categorization is not only tenable, but necessary for a complete account of categorization"
- specific emotions framework rather than one or two dimensional conceptualization (arousal and valence)

Overview
• Experimental investigation of nature of, constraints on, and conditions of use of emotional response categories.
• Participants sorted triads of concepts that shared both emotional and nonemotional relations -> experiencing emotional states moderates the use of emotional response categories.
• Multidimensional scaling of similarity judgements by emotional and nonemotional perceivers -> major mechanism: selective attention.

Theoretical Argument:
• Basic categorization theories:
 - Similarity approach: matching/mismatching features
 - Theory approach: causal theory about deeper structure
• Emotional response categorization (citation!):
 1. Speciﬁc emotions provide the structure for emotional response categories (as compared to one- or two-dimensional conceptualizations): grouping of objects that evoke the same emotional response
 2. The experience of such states of emotion is associated with a reorganization of concepts into groups that correspond to the proposed set of speciﬁc emotions (i.e., emotional response categories)
 3. The conceptual (re)organization is due to selective attention to the emotional responses associated with represented and perceived stimuli, which results in those stimuli being classified in terms of their emotional response category membership.


Experimental Design and Results:
• Experiment 1: Test of basic hypothesis
 - Treatment: Inducing emotional state (sad vs. happy vs. neutral) among participants by ﬁlms and music.
 - Triad task in which participants were instructed to choose which of two concepts was most similar to a third, target concept: e.g. trophy -> helmet vs. wedding ring.
 - Result: People in emotional states ground categories in discrete emotional responses (for both, happy and sad treatment and triads).
 - 2 Follow-Ups: Mixed triads & varying triad type only between participants.
• Experiment 2: Alternative emotion
 - Treatment: See above, sad vs. fear vs. neutral.
 - Result: Same pattern as above.
• Experiment 3: Eliciting emotions vs. priming of emotion knowledge
 - Treatment: Same ﬁlm condition as in experiment 1 + processing instructions (no instructions vs. point-of-view instructions), only happy triads.
 - Result: Eﬀects did not occur in the absence of the associative feeling states (i.e. the point-of-view conditions). Emotional information as such is therefore not suﬃcient.
• Experiment 4: High vs. low dysphoria
 - Procedure: same as in experiment 1, comparing participants with high and low dysphoria (measured previously with the Beck Depression Inventory) instead of emotion induction.
 - Result: Participants with high dysphoria were more likely to group together concepts on the basis of sadness and less likely to group together concepts on the basis of happiness.
• Selective attention as mechanism to for categorization
 - Treatment: emotion induction by music (happy vs. sad vs. neutral)
 - Similarity ratings of faces (based on expressed emotion, gender or head orientation): Quantify attention weights given to emotional and nonemotional stimulus information by individual diﬀerence multidimensional scaling
 - Result: People in emotional states weight emotion-related aspects of the stimuli more heavily. Individuals in both happy and sad emotional states rated same-expression face pairs as more similar than neutral people, regardless of the match between the emotion expressed by the faces and the emotion the participants were experiencing (=emotion congruence prediction).

Conclusion and Relevance:
• Experiments show that emotion is an important basis of categorization. Several different experimental accounts show that during emotional states, individuals are more likely to base their categorization judgements on their emotional responses.
• Main implication: the perceiver’s internal responses to external stimuli - not just features and conceptual relationships inherent to those stimuli - are inﬂuential in the process of categorization.},

We argue that aid shocks-severe decreases in aid revenues-inadvertently shift the domestic balance of power and potentially induce violence. During aid shocks, potential rebels gain bargaining strength vis-a-vis the government. To appease the rebels, the government must promise future resource transfers, but the government has no incentive to continue its promised transfers if the aid shock proves to be temporary. With the government unable to credibly commit to future resource transfers, violence breaks out. Using AidData's comprehensive dataset of bilateral and multilateral aid from 1981 to 2005, we evaluate the effects of foreign aid on violent armed conflict. In addition to rare-event logit analysis, we employ matching methods to account for the possibility that aid donors anticipate conflict. The results show that negative aid shocks significantly increase the probability of armed conflict onset.},

- early psychology as well as the commonsense lay view of behavior was/is arguing that behavior is best predicted and understood in terms of personality traits
-> author disagrees and provides a meta-analysis of empirical evidence supporting his view: not personality traits but situational factors are decisive
- predict behavior: examine primary trait the situation taps
- explain behavior: call on a personality trait
-> psychology and commonsense view were very close

1) empirical evidence suggests that predictability based on personality traits is rather weak
2) psychologists and lay people exaggerated predictability due to perceptual & judgmental illusions
3) reliance on traits may be disadvantageous for lay people -> counterproductive

- Hieder: environment is decisive for behavior, but actors are more salient so reasons for behavior are attributed to them
- meta-study: traits have low predictive power
- lay people's belief in traits is unlikely to have empirical basis (only under certain circumstances)
- people are not able to assign accurate personality scores (errors due to prior expectations, prmacy effects, perseverance of judgments, halo effects)
- layperson more nomothetic than idiographic trait theorist
-> but predictions on the basis of very similar situations are good! author argues that people are not selective

Rather they were forced [...] upon the Crown." -> but: they still see institutions as endogenous? - "The principal lesson of our article is that the fundamental institutions of representative government - an explicit set of multiple veto points along with the primacy of the common law courts over economic affairs - are intimately related to the struggle for control over governmental power"},

- Overall, they find that although there is some shared variance between imp/exp attitude they are distinct from one another (i.e., a two factor latent variable model fits better, they found convergent and discriminant validity between the two). They say collapsing the two is ‘hazardous reductionism’, however, they can’t differentiate between dual-process and dual-representation in conceptualizing imp and exp.
- pg. 26 “The most useful metaphor for the interaction of implicit and explicit evaluations is still a matter of debate (Gilbert, 1999). Our findings support a view that, whatever their source, implicit and explicit attitudes have substantive, independent, properties and that neither of two extreme conceptions is a useful description of the data: (1) Implicit and explicit attitude measures assess exclusive constructs that have nothing in common, and (2) implicit and explicit attitude measures assess the same thing, varying only as a function of common sources of methodological variation.”
- Take Home: Imp/exp are two different constructs. Table 2 shows that correlation between them depends on domain and thus social desirability also plays a role (specifically in WB).},

- argues against threat hypothesis (-> racism higher in neighborhoods with high % blacks due to power threat)
- environmental effects are more complex, socioeconomic context has to be taken into account
- living among uneducated whites has greater effect on white's racial attitudes, than living among blacks
- effect not explained by interracial competition but rather by psychological response of (general) out-group hostility due to low status context/stressful collective circumstances
=> context is less important than individual effects explaining prejudice (?)

study:
- 1991 national race and politics study, 1854 white respondents
- measure education, racial composition of areas as well as individual-level variables

main results:
- zip code level of education rather than %black predicts racial predispositions
- effect of educational composition does not change with racial environment -> speaks against threat hypothesis
- racial and educational composition shape opinions on race-targeted policies, but only on the connected contextual level

alternative explanations to environment:
- racial hostility as part of general out-group hostility created by low-status environments
- education level captures social norm
- unmeasured differences in individual-level characteristics

questions/comments:
- analysis might be problematic, does not take into account multilevel structure -> multi-level modeling could not be used because of low number of respondents in each zip-code},

- experiental openeness only weakly related to RWA (but it has a direct effect on racism) 
- cognitive openness and NFC werepowerful predictors of RWA (and only affects racism mediated through RWA)

We may think of the group decision problem as a choice between a new rule and the status quo. The rule and the status quo are each common outcomes that apply across all individuals, but the value or cost that they induce on each individual differs according to each individual's circumstances: some gain, some lose, and others are unaffected by a change to the new from the old. Rather than casting votes, each subject submits a bid reflecting his willingness to pay to induce the group to select one option and the amount he wishes to be paid if the alternative option is selected. The Compensation Election chooses the option that receives the highest sum of bids. We find that, although the Compensation Election allows subjects to strategically bid above their value (or even for the option they do not prefer), such behavior is not the norm. We also find that subjects' bids more truthfully reveal their values when there are more bidders in the election.},

summary:
- Degree to which people are physiologically responsive to threat appears to indicate the degree to which they advocate policies that protect the existing social structure from both external and internal threats. 
- When presented with threatening and non-threatening stimuli, skin conductance and blink response were measured, it was shown that those who were more conservative were more responsive to the threats.
- Can’t say anything about causal relationship with this.

Questions: 
- direction of causality unclear 
- one effect is significant only after controlling for other factors (?) 
- selection on observables but no blocking},

Argument: When we look at opinion over time, it remains remarkably stable. This can be said to be do to the miracle of aggregation. While people may make errors in reporting opinion, those tend to cancel each other out ad we are left with genuine signal. Additionally, responses seem to be rational. This is because when opinion changes on issues, it tends to change across a wide range of demographic groups. These groups may have different preferences though.

  comment   = {Main Argument: 
Decision strategies vary across task environments. The authors review theoretical frameworks to approach task and context eﬀects: a) cost/beneﬁt principles, b) perceptual processes, and c) adaptive production systems.

Approach & Method: 
Literature review diﬀerentiates between task and context characteristics as determinants for decision strategies. Several inﬂuences are discussed and evaluated: task complexity, response mode, information display, agenda eﬀects, similarity eﬀects, quality of option set.

Results:
Decision making is a highly contingent form of information processing. Based on the empirical evidence, the authors conclude that cost/beneﬁt and perceptual frameworks have strong support. However, there are many open questions, e.g. regarding the measurement of error, as well as questions of awareness and learning. Overall, there is a need for a unifying approach that focuses on the processes of decision behavior.

=================================================================

- Given different task environments people use different decisions strategies. The article looks three different theoretical frameworks of cost/benefit principles, perceptual processes and adaptive production systems. It finds support for both the cost/benefit principles and perceptual principles. 

Cost/benefit
- Strategy selection is the result of a compromise between the desire to make a correct decision and the desire to minimize effort.
- “The framework maintains an assumption of rationality on the part of the decision maker. That is, the observed use of a suboptimal decision rule can be seen as the result of a rational cost/benefit approach to strategy selection.”

Perceptual processes
- Prospect theories and the heuristics and biases approach trace decision behavior to basic principles governing human perception.
- See things as gains or losses not absolute levels of wealth

Production systems
- Rule based theories of decision theory
- A system of productions – if the conditions of a production is satisfied the action is taken

Task complexity
- As complexity increase the use of non-compensatory strategies will increase
- Three factors affect task complexity: Number of alternatives (strongest evidence for this one); Number of information dimensions about each alternative; Time Pressure
- This supports the cost/benefit principles framework

Response Mode
- Judgment on successive alternative given one at a time versus choice between the two options
- Choice mode – dimensional – each gamble is compared on one dimension – most important dimension is the probability of winning and losing
- Judgment mode – anchoring and adjustment – the anchor is the amount to win for a gamble that is basically positive

Information Display
- subjects use the dimensions of gambles as they are presented to them rath then transform them into final outcomes or calculate subjective moments.

Agenda Effects 

Similarity of Alternatives
- “the addition of an alternative to an offered set hurts alternatives that are similar to the added alternative more than those that are dissimilar to it.” (Tversky 1972)

  comment   = {Main Argument:
People adapt their decision processes to changes in the structure of available alternatives and to the presence of time pressure. This adaptation is mainly consistent with the fact that, depending on the decision environment, strategies vary in their relative accuracy and eﬀort.

Approach & Method:
Simulation compared the relative eﬀort and accuracy of several decision strategies under diﬀerent conditions with regard to time pressure and structure of alternatives. Two experiments investigated whether participants adapt their search patterns consistent with the ﬁndings from the simulations.

Results: 
Overall, the simulations and the experimental ﬁndings were consistent. Under certain conditions, heuristics are fairly good in approximating (truncated) weighted additive rules. The search patterns in the experiments show that individual adapt their decision strategies consistent with these ﬁndings.

=======================================================================

Time Pressure results
a. People may first try to accelerate processing to keep up
b. If time pressure is too much then they might filter information and only focus on a subset
c. Lastly people may change strategies if its too much

switching to heuristics
a. optimistic for rationality
b. may be done when accuracy/effort tradeoff is at a certain level
c. done when there is no other choice

more on heuristics
a. no single one did well across all task and context conditions
b. if decision makers wanted a high level of accuracy they would have to use heuristics adaptively
c. found that several attribute based heuristics (EBA and Lexographic) were more accurate than normative procedures because they could be done completely when subject to time pressure
d. ultimate view is that while the simulation they ran was not conclusive it did provide insight that strategy selection was important by noting that strategy selection does occur across various environment and that there are plenty of releveant variables

experiments
a. subjects acquired less information, spent less time per acquisition, spent more time on the most important attribute, used more attribute based processing when dispersion in weights, context variable, was high rather than low

=> take home: experiments mirrored the simulation, people are good at using different decision strategies to solve problems, but no single strategy is the best},

Main Question:
How does conscious and automatic processing aﬀect the quality and accuracy of decision-making?

Approach & Method:
Laboratory and ﬁeld studies on consumer choice; investigation of quality of decision and post-choice satisfaction.

Results: 
Original studies conﬁrmed the deliberation without attention hypothesis: simple choices (such as between diﬀerent towels or diﬀerent sets of oven mitts) indeed produce better results after conscious thought, but for choices in complex matters (such as between diﬀerent houses or diﬀerent cars), unconscious processing performs better. However, Payne et al. argue that one has to further account for the interaction between forms of processing and choice environments when considering how to approach complex choice problems: self-paced conscious thought can perform better than unconscious thought, e.g. when the decision task depends on questions of magnitude.

=====================================================================

overview: 
- Dijksterhuis et al. (2006) and Dijkesterhuis & Nordgren (2006) argued that unconscious thought might be better than conscious thought for some decisions
 a. Unconscious thought: object relevant or task-relevant cognitive or affective thought processes that occur while conscious attention is directed elsewhere
 b. Conscious thought: deliberation with attention focused on the problem. 
 c. Unconscious thought is good at forming global or holistic impressionsd, weights the relative importance in a relatively objective and natural way and is less capacity constrained than conscious thought
 d. Conscious thought may be better for simple decisions or following a single rule (i.e. lexicographic)

Findings:
a. Found conscious thought performed similarly to unconscious thought in a choice task when the conscious thought is self-paced rather than constrained
b. Interpret these findings as evidence of poor constrained conscious thought as opposed to unconscious being better
c. Self-paced thought can outperform unconscious thought in a choice environment where performance depends on the magnitude of information. Thinking is that unconscious thought is relatively insensitive to magnitudes

  comment   = {General Overview: 
Payne explores the effect of racial cues on the perceptual identification of weapons. This article was in response to a number of “recent” (c. 2000) racial profiling cases in which police officers opened fire on a black suspect because they perceived that the suspect was in possession of a weapon when they were simply be holding a wallet or some other inconsequential object. Payne asks whether such cases are a result of automatic processes related to stereotyping and, if so, to what extent do we have conscious control over such reactions.

Theoretical Background: 
- Group stereotypes may be activated outside of awareness and may influence behavior without the knowledge or intent of the perceiver (Devine 1989; Wittenbrink et al. 1997).
- In reaction time (RT) experiments, primes related to stereotyped group members tend to facilitate responses to negatively valenced and stereotypical target words (Gaertner & McLaughloin 1983; Banaji & Hardin 1996; others).
- Violent traits such as hostility, aggression, and criminality are consistently included in White Americans' stereotypes of Black Americans (Devine & Elliot, 1995; Dovidio, Evans & Tyler, 1986) and guns are semantically associated with violence and aggression. 

Approach: 
- Payne uses two experimental reaction-time studies to explore his hypotheses that weapon recognition is affected by implicit racial cues. In both studies, participants were exposed to a prime of either a black or a white face for 200 ms immediately before a target picture was presented (i.e. SOA of 200ms). The task of the participants was to identify whether the target pictures were pictures of a ”gun” or of a “tool” (i.e. everyday hand tool) as fast as possible without making too many mistakes. In other words, it was a 2 (prime race: black vs. white) X2 (target type: gun vs. tool) factorial design with both factors manipulated within participants. In addition, participants completed the Modern Racism scale (McConahay et al. 1981) and the Motivation to Control Prejudiced Reactions scale (Dunton & Fazio 1997).
- The two experiments were identical in every way except: 
-> In the first experiment no time limit is imposed for the participants’ response. 
-> In the second experiment, a response time limit of 500ms is imposed. 
- A Process Dissociation Approach (i.e. differences between performance when a person intends to respond in a certain way and the performance when the person intends not to respond in that way) was used to estimate the distinct contributions of automatic bias and controlled perception to task performance (Jacoby 1991).

Findings:
1) Participants respond faster to guns with a black prime than a white prime (experiment 1)
	
	2) Participants responded with more type I errors with a black prime
	than a white prime (experiment 2) 
3) Automatic and controlled PDP estimates differed as a function of the prime. Specifically, automatic estimates were higher for black prime than white prime, whereas the controlled estimate same for both. This was true both with respect to reaction times (experiment 1) and error rates (experiment 2). 
4) Motivation to control prejudice (explicit measure) moderates the relationship between explicit attitudes and performance in both reaction time (experiment 1) and error rates (experiment 2)

Implications / Who Cares? 
- The presence of racial information can systematically biases the identification of weapons, and this is largely an automatic process. 
- Article seemed to be geared toward an audience interested in reducing racial profiling in police encounters. Implications for political attitudes?

===========================================================================

- Process Disposition Procedure (PDP) distinct contributions from automatic bias and controlled perception to task performance, to look at influence of racial cues with priming paradigm
- Whites tend to associate hostility, aggression, and criminality w/Blacks, and therefore race may influence their judgment of what is and is not a weapon.
- Results: error rates were higher, and tools were misidentified more often than guns, more with Black prime than with White prime. Race of prime didn’t affect misidentification of gun as tool
- Take-away: automatic racial stereotypes influence motivational behaviors; motivation is automatic rather than cognitive},

One developmental aspect of the party systems is singled out for description and analysis in this paper. It is argued that European party systems in terms of electoral volatility, i.e. rates of net change in the electorates, are drifting away from each other. Some of the party systems which have traditionally been considered volatile, apparently are becoming less so, while some other systems are taking on the character of highly volatile party systems. A simple set of hypotheses, based upon the notion of party space, is proposed in order to account for the variation observed. The data lend support to the hypothesis that electoral volatility is a function of the format of the party system and of short-term changes in that format.},

  comment   = {Background: welfare and crime are not explicitly racial, but have become associated with Blacks. Dual process models – here this means that they have negative stereotypes (theory), but also other cognitive considerations about whether or not they support a given policy (data). The dual process masks the connection between stereotypes and policy preference.

The Question: Is there a connection between stereotypes and policy preferences? Do Whites who hold negative black stereotypes show less support for welfare and policy that will benefit Blacks? 

The Theory: 

The Method: survey experiments – they vary race and the information about the target (negative or positive). Whites only, dividing those who endorse and those who oppose negative stereotypes. Welfare mother experiment. Drug search experiment.

Findings: 1. A substantial population still endorses the negative black work ethic stereotypes and negative black hostility stereotypes. 2. They don’t find a difference in judgement between race, BUT they do find that relevant negative black stereotypes influence negative judgements of African Americans. Because those who hold negative stereotypes of Blacks, judge them more harshly, while those who do not endorse negative stereotypes judge them more positively. 3. For whites who endorse negative stereotypes, their theory driven (i.e. stereotypical) judgements can be reversed when they receive high degree of contrary information.

Critical Thoughts: Sidanius and the differences between reaction to men and women is relevant here. Also implicit racism, they argue that they don’t contradict Devine or an idea of implicit racism, this is just a situation where those who consciously reject the stereotype can control their impulses. 
It also speaks the whole issue of racism being confounded with conservative ideology (it’s interesting that Sniderman is on this). They only reference conservative ideology in the literature review, with the idea of the dual process. Do they really isolate racism here? Not exactly, first of all they don’t measure it, but they get around it by measuring expectations (like the actual stereotypes instead of policy support). In theory this means someone could expect a welfare mother to try to find a job, but still be opposed to welfare. But this sort of seems unlikely? In other words, liberal and conservative are probably still mixed into each group?},

The result of this cumulative approach is a measure of democracy that, for every country-year, is at least as reliable as the most reliable component measure and is accompanied by quantitative estimates of uncertainty in the level of democracy. Moreover, for those who wish to continue using previously existing scales or to evaluate research performed using those scales, we extract information from the new measure to perform heretofore impossible direct comparisons between component scales. Specifically, we estimate the relative reliability of the constituent indicators, compare the specific ordinal levels of each of the existing measures in relationship to one another and assess overall levels of disagreement across raters. We make the UDS and associated parameter estimates freely available online and provide a detailed tutorial that demonstrates how to best use the UDS in applied work.},

  comment   = {overview:
- People explain things by telling a story about it script/schema helps interpret facts/info, create casual models to make sense of the world
- People sensitive to evidence as it creates the story, but also other causal direction of creating story first then accept/reject new info based on how well it fits into story.
- Takeaway: gives structure or narrative to explain event; then info integrated as it fits into story
- Criticism: dumbed down version of mental models to have you make decisions of behaviors/choices.

Research question:
- How do people come up with causal explanations and what are their implications on decision-making?
- Jurors impose a story-like organization on trial information and use this organization to evaluate evidence on the basis of multiple verdict judgment dimensions. 
 
Three components
1. Evidence evaluation through story construction.
2. Representation of the decision alternatives by learning verdict category attributes.
3. Reaching a decision through the classification of the story into the best-fitting verdict category.
 
Four certainty principles
1. Coverage
2. Coherence
3. Uniqueness
4. Goodness-of-fit
 
Previous Research
1. Story structures are spontaneously created as evidence summaries
2. Story structures vary with verdict decisions
3. Story-like evidence summaries mediate decisions
 
Experiment 1
1. Setup: Participants read courtroom transcript of a criminal trial, including a case summary and the testimony of four witnesses.
2. Independent Variables: Evidence order and Credibility of Inconsistent Witness
3. Dependent Variables:: Verdict decision and Pr(Defendant = Guilty)
4. Findings: Presentation order matters, Story organization leads to verdicts in the direction of the preponderance of the evidence, Interaction between Credibility and Evidence Order (see Figure 3)
 
Experiment 2
1. Setup: Participants read testimony about a felony case. 
2. Independent Variables: Story organization (Basic, Conviction, Acquittal) 
3. Dependent Variable: Response Mode (Item-By-Item and Global)
4. Findings: Case materials that focus on one story shift evidence evaluations in the direction of that story, Global assessments are more extreme than item-by-item assessments, even though they are based on the same information, item-by-item judgement is best described by an averaging model that incorporates recency effects, global judgements are best described by an equal-serial position weight model, information aggregation is not a Bayesian aggregation process

Experiment 3
1. Setup: Similar to Experiment 2, except that materials for a burglar case were added to the felony case and only two versions (convict and acquit) were presented. Two cases (embezzlement and burglary) were presented, one of which was a convict version and the other an acquit version. 
2. Independent Variable: Case version
3. Dependent Variable: Strength of Evidence favoring guilt or innocence (Response Mode: Item-by-item and Global)
4. Findings: There is an interaction between response mode and case version such that story supplements affect global ratings more than they affect item-by-item ratings. 

Discussion
- Stronger verdict judgments are generated when the evidence is organized as a story, rather than a legal argument. They are more confident about those judgments, credibility information has a greater impact on story-based decisions, and this is not tied to the memorability of the evidence. 
- More complete stories move decisions in their favor and story construction strategies increase the impact of the information that completes the story. 
- Stories are schemas that help jurors make decisions in the courtroom.

Implications
- Memory-based vs. on-line processes depend on the nature of the evaluation.
- On-line updating occurs when subjects are given the judgment task before the evidence is presented and are asked to make judgments throughout the course of evidence presentation. Memory-based processes occur when item-by-item evaluations are not required, or when the criteria on which to base decisions are not clear and the complexity of the evidence requires an informed choice. 
- For explanation-based tasks, the organization of memory (not just its content) is relevant.},

  abstract  = {The Dual Process Model of ideology and prejudice (DPM) proposes specific information-processing mechanisms by which broad-bandwidth personality shapes social worldviews. We adapt a classic anchoring and adjustment paradigm and show that Openness to Experience interacts with exposure to information about safety and threat to shape judgments of societal threat and danger. Those low in Openness to Experience were more sensitive to anchor information about the proportion of dangerous and threatening people in society (Study 1). The moderating effect of Openness to Experience on dangerous worldview estimates was due specifically to an intellect or cognitive component of this personality trait, rather than an aesthetic component (Study 2). These results indicate low Openness increases the tendency to be anchored by threat-relevant cues.},

  abstract  = {How do modern individuals form a sense of the vast societies in which they live? Social cognition has evolved to make sense of small, intimate social groups, but in complex mass societies, comparable vivid social cues are scarcer. Extant research on political attitudes and behavior has emphasized media and interpersonal networks as key sources of cues. Extending a classical argument, we provide evidence for the importance of an alternative and internal source: imagination. With a focus on social welfare, we collected survey data from two very different democracies, the United States and Denmark, and conducted several studies using explicit, implicit, and behavioral measures. By analyzing the effects of individual differences in imagination, we demonstrate that political cognition relies on vivid, mental simulations that engage evolved social and emotional decision-making mechanisms. It is in the mind's eye that vividness and engagement are added to people's sense of mass politics.},

  abstract  = {This analysis studies how variation in individuals' motivation to form accurate judgments affects the process of political discussion. I use a small-group experiment in which participants compete to elect the simulated candidate who best represents their true preferences. I manipulate economic incentives to control participants' accuracy motivations. The results show that accuracy-motivated participants, compared to those with weaker accuracy goals, seek discussants with more expertise and a more diverse set of viewpoints, place greater emphasis on socially provided messages, and reduce emphasis on political predispositions. As a result of these differences, however, accuracy-motivated participants rely more heavily on biased information. Hence, accuracy motivations do not produce more accurate judgments or better decisions. Although previous work on political discussion has largely ignored the role of motivations, these results suggest that accuracy motivations play an important but nuanced role in this process. Strengthened accuracy motivations increase individuals' exposure to political expertise and ideological diversity but also increase their potential to be misled.},

Using a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis of knowledge items drawn from American National Election Studies, we find that the scales used in recent research are not sufficiently invariant for valid comparisons across a host of theoretically important grouping variables. We demonstrate that it is possible to construct valid invariant scales using a subset of items and show the impact of invariance by comparing results from the valid and invalid scales. We provide an analysis of differential item functioning based on grouping variables commonly used in political science research to explore the utility of each item in the construction of valid knowledge scales. An application of the VTT suggests it is more appropriate to conceive of these items as effects of a latent variable rather than cause or formative indicators. These results suggest that models attempting to explain apparent knowledge gaps between subgroups have been unsuccessful because previously constructed scales were validated by fiat.},

- liberal/traditional countries: universalism + benevolence -> left; conformity + tradition -> right

  abstract  = {This paper shows a general nonparametric unfolding technique for maximizing the correct classification of binary choice or two-category data. The motivation for and the primary focus of the unfolding technique are parliamentary roll call voting data. However, the procedures that implement the unfolding also can be applied to the problem of unfolding rank order data as well as analyzing a data set that would normally be the subject of a probit, logit, or linear probability analysis. One aspect of the scaling method greatly improves Manski's ï¿½maximum score estimatorï¿½ technique for estimating limited dependent variable models. To unfold binary choice data two subproblems must be solved. First, given a set of chooser or legislator points, a cutting plane must be found such that it divides the legislators/choosers into two sets that reproduce the actual choices as closely as possible. Second, given a set of cutting planes for the binary choices, a point for each chooser or legislator must be found which reproduces the actual choices as closely as possible. Solutions for these two problems are shown in this paper. Monte Carlo tests of the procedure show it to be highly accurate in the presence of voting error and missing data.},

To explain this seeming paradox, I argue that greater media choice makes it easier for people to find their preferred content. People who like news take advantage of abundant political information to become more knowledgeable and more likely to turn out. In contrast, people who prefer entertainment abandon the news and become less likely to learn about politics and go to the polls. To test this proposition, I develop a measure of people's media content preference and include it in a representative opinion survey of2,358 U.S. residents. Resultshow that content preference indeed becomes a better predictor of political knowledge and turnout as media choice increases. Cable TV and the Internet increase gaps in knowledge and turnout between people who prefer news and people who prefer entertainment.},

results:
- incentives + extra time increase correct responses, effect of extra time seems stronger
- effect of incentives and extra time is especially pronounced for different subgroups (sociodemographics, interest etc.)

- differential motivation cannot really be overcome with monetary incentive
- including preparation time might further increase deviations due to motivation alone

- Provide examples of how economic policies might be shaped by prospect theory preferences

======================================================

- Problem 1-4 – The standards in other nations effects the reference point of the people in a nation, and changing this reference point can change the choice of policy. 
- Incumbency effect – the challenger is seen as more risky than an incumbent, people are only willing to throw out the incumbent and accept the risky challenger when in the domain of losses or when the economy is doing poorly. 
- Framing a policy as preventing a negative state or providing a positive state can change support levels –women’s right as the ERA undoing a negative state or framed as improving women’s status in society.
- 5 percent unemployment vs. 95 percent employment.
- Rationality of voting – 
- Voter’s illusion – people believe that actions and attitudes are correlated so if people vote that is an indication that people like them will vote and if people don’t vote that is an indication that people like them wont’ vote. (no no no no no). People exposed to party-supporter theory and non-aligned voter’s theory and more people decided to vote when exposed to party-supporter theory (all hypothetical making it extremely suspect and not sure what this has to do with prospect theory)},

Yet fully a quarter century later, that theory remains the dominant paradigm for understanding mass-elite linkage in politics. We present an alternative spatial theory of elections that we argue has greater empirical verisimilitude. Based on the ideas of symbolic politics, the directional theory assumes that most people have a diffuse preference for a certain direction of policy-making and that people vary in the intensity with which they hold those preferences. We test the two competing theories at the individual level with National Election Study data and find the directional theory more strongly supported than the traditional spatial theory. We then develop the implications of the directional theory for candidate behavior and assess the predictions in light of evidence from the U.S. Congress.},

It is argued that the effect of economic adversity depends upon the degree of welfare state development. This relationship is argued to be nonlinear, so that mobilization occurs at either extreme while withdrawal obtains in the middle range. The importance to democratic theory, the study of elections, and the politics of welfare policy are discussed.},

In the familiar terms of economic voting, this negativity bias implies that voters are more likely to punish than reward incumbents for the status of the economy. However, economic conditions affect not only how people vote but whether they vote, such that during periods of poor economic performance much of the public resentment toward the in-party is absorbed by abstention (Rosenstone 1982). Thus, the impact of recession is muted by the reduced propensity of those suffering its effects to actually vote- Given this fact, it appears that the president' s party is more consistently rewarded for its economic successes than it is punished for its failures.},

  comment   = {Background: Cues help us categorize people, which we use may depend on the context. For example, in politics we use the parties. People can pay attention to theory (theory driven processing) i.e. stereotypes or data (data driven processing) i.e. individual information about a person (she calls this a dual process model – this is basically the same dual process model that Peffley et. al 1997 talk about).

The Question: How do people use partisan stereotypes? Do they? When?

The Theory: Dual process model. People try to use theory (stereotypes) whenever possible. They will use data, when it is impossible to use theory or when there is a lot of contradicting information.

The Method: Experiment – videos of two fictional candidates. Manipulates amount of information and consistency of information.

Findings: Voters go with theory, even in situations of extreme information inconsistency. In the absence of the party label, then voters engage in data driven processing.

Critical Thoughts: This goes will with motivated reasoning ideas. That people have an idea of what the party is and when they are confronted with contradicting information they try to reason it into agreeing with what they already know. Though notably there is no role for affect in her theory. Also, see Lodge and Hamill 1986 that partisan schematics are more likely to make mistakes. Also, think about how this is relevant to the misinformation literature – like Nyhan, but also Redlawsk et. al 2010. The latter found that a relatively small amount of inconsistency could create opinion change, but the results here seem to argue against that. Other general questions, partisan stereotypes are so prevalent are they unique in some way?},

Drawing on a multicommunity survey conducted in several American towns and cities in 2002, the authors examine the individual and contextual origins of general social trust using the techniques of Hierarchical Linear Modeling. Based on prevailing theoretical understandings of social trust, the authors posit a comprehensive model to account for the contextual variation that remains after controlling for individual- level variables. Two community-level variables, voter turnout and commute times, emerge as important contextual predictors of social trust. The authors explore community attachment as a potential mediator of these effects, finding that it partially mediates the impact of commuting but not voter turnout, results consistent with their distinction between ``experiential{''} and ``cultural{''} theories of social trust formation.},

The prominence of affect suggests that all social information processing is affectively charged and prone to biases. This article makes use of a unique data set collected using a dynamic information board experiment to test important effects of motivated reasoning. In particular, affective biases should cause citizens to take longer processing information incongruent with their existing affect and such biases should also direct search for new information about candidates. Somewhat perversely, motivated reasoners may actually increase their support of a positively evaluated candidate upon learning new negatively evaluated information. Findings are reported that support all of these expectations. Additional analysis shows that these affective biases may easily lead to lower quality decision making, leading to a direct challenge to the notion of voters as rational Bayesian updaters.},

This paper reports results from a series of process-tracing experiments designed to learn how voters in a presidential primary election adopt and use such strategies. Different voters adopt different strategies, with the choice of strategy dependent on the campaign environment and individual voter characteristics. The adoption of particular strategies can have implications for how voters evaluate candidates.},
  comment        = {Main Question:
How does the information environment aﬀect information processing and decision strategies in the context of election campaigns? In how far do the search patterns have an inﬂuence on subsequent evaluations?

Approach & Method: 
Comparing results for dynamic and static information boards with information about four and two candidates; measuring depth of search and comparability of search.

Results: 
Mixed results for hypothesis 1 (complex environment leads to more structured search); stronger support for hypothesis 2 (more non-compensatory search in complex environments) and 3 (use of compensatory rules moderates political evaluations)

===================================================================

- Strategies can result in failure to make normatively good decisions because of competing goals between making correct decisions and minimizing resources (Lau, 2003; Stroh, 1995)
- Compensatory rules: different attributes are explicitly compared to one another on some measure and a low score on one attribute can be compensated for a high score on another (Lau, 1995) 
- Noncompensatory: people try to avoid making the tradeoffs (Hogarth, 1987). Voters may use that consider alternatives serially and those that don’t meet minium expectation level are immediately discarded. This strategy can lead to errors where the objectively best thing is dropped
- If information search varies in systematic ways than it is important to understand when it does because the decisions may be different given different information levels

Information search
a. Depth of search: refers to amount of relevant information that can actually considered. Deep searches suggest compensatory and shallow suggest noncompensatory
b. Comparability of alternatives: voters gather the same information about relevant candidates
c. Sequence of search: may do it randomly or systematic. i.e. intra-attribute where they make transitions from one candidate to another based on attribute or intra-candidate

Dynamic information board
a. Clicking on one item means that they forego the option of clicking on other bits of information
b. Some information appears more often than other information with the idea that this simulates the feel of an actual campaign

Hypotheses:
1) In a more difficult decision environment, information search will be more structured, as evidence by a greater likelihood that voters will use an identifiable decision rule.
2) Compensatory decision rules are more likely to be used in the easiest decision environments, whereas non-compensatory rules will predominate in more complex environments. Those with greater cognitive resources will be more likely to use compensatory rules.
3) The use of non-compensatory rules should moderate candidate evaluations relative to those reached by voters using non-compensatory rules. (Those using compensatory rules will learn a lot about candidate including things they like and dislike)
-> Uses both a dynamic and structured search environment and two and four candidates.

Results
a. Static information board users looked at about half the information that dynamic board users did. Within each, no difference between two and four candidate conditions
b. Subjects in two candidate conditions searched for comparable information more than those in the four candidate condition
c. Greater comparability for the easier two candidate condition, but they searched less deeply in the four candidate condition
d. Structured strategy searches (either compensatory or noncompensatory) were observed in 50% of people for static and 67% ish for dynamic
e. In both static and dynamic, people facing four candidates were more likely to use noncompensatory rules. Subjects in more demanding dynamic environment used noncompensatory also. 
f. Compensatory use decreases with age. Political expertise not significant, but education was significant. 
g. Compensatory strategy lead to rating the non-preferred candidate higher than the noncompensatory users.},

  comment   = {overview:
- dynamic information board experiment
- tipping point: degree of incongruent information at which motivated reasoning is replaced by more accurate processing and belief reversal
- motivated reasoning and affective intelligence as two contrasting mechanisms
- with low degrees of incongruent information, individuals behave as motivated reasoners -> bolster their prior attitude
- more incongruent information -> anxiety -> affective intelligence -> more balanced processing -> belief reversal
- abundance of incongruent information leads to anxiety which in turn decreases motivated reasoning and counterarguing of information that contradicts the individuals' prior attitudes
-> affect towards a known candidate is an important factor to the extent accurate information is perceived. Voters may become even more positive to a candidate they like upon learning something negative. There is a point where tipping of attitudes occurs


============================================================================

overview:
- Small amounts of disconfirming evidence tend to either be discounted or lead to attitude strengthening. This paper examines whether there is a level of disconfirming evidence beyond which motivated reasoning effects are overwhelmed and belief updating occurs.
- Affective intelligence drives the proposed “tipping point” effect. Motivated reasoning is typically a subconscious system 1 process. Continual exposure to disconfirming evidence, however, causes anxiety, which eventually causes system 2 deliberative processes to activate. At this point, disconfirming evidence results in “rational” belief updating.
- The authors conduct a dynamic process tracing experiment to test this. The key manipulation is the proportion of disconfirming evidence concerning one’s favored candidate.
- Results show that once disconfirming evidence reaches levels of about 28% and beyond, rational belief updating begins to occur.
- Question: Does the presence of other acceptable candidates influence where the affective tipping point lies?
- Question: Is there a role for priors in determining how much disconfirming information is needed to induce corrective belief updating?


============================================================================

overview:
- Starting point: Motivated reasoners perceive and evaluate negative information about a preferred candidate in a biased way and become even more supportive of their candidate (theory of motivated reasoning). 
- RQ 1: Is there a limit to this process? Is there a tipping point where motivated reasoners stop being immune to disconfirming information and start updating their candidate evaluation more accurately? 
- RQ 2: On which mechanism is this tipping working? 

Theory: 
- The theory of motivated reasoning explains why we do not update correctly. 
- The theory on affective intelligence explains why we do update correctly: because we become anxious in face of incongruent information we think harder and update our evaluations correctly. 
- We have empirical evidence for both phenomena: attitude strengthening effects despite being exposed to disconfirming evidence as well as accurately updating an existing evaluation as the new evidence would suggest. Hence, those two theories are not mutually exclusive, but supplement each other: which of these theories (mechanisms) is working is a specific case depends on the amount of disconfirming evidence. When the amount of disconfirming information is small, individuals engage in motivated reasoning, when the

Hypotheses:
1: Initially, as more disconfirming information about a preferred candidate is encountered, the positive evaluation of the candidate becomes stronger (motivated reasoning). 
2: The motivated reasoning does not work infinitely, there exists a tipping point. The tipping point is reached at a certain amount of disconfirming information. 
3: The mechanism that leads to accurate updating beyond the tipping point is affective intelligence (the biased recipient becomes anxious (=less certain) of whether the preferred candidate is really to be preferred and engages in more active information seeking and more accurate updating). 

Empirical analysis (supporting Hypos): 
Experiment, in which subjects seek for information about a preferred candidate on an information board. Questionnaires at the beginning, in between and at the end. Hypo 1 & 2: Treatment (x) is the probability of encountering negative information on a preferred candidate. Outcome (y) is the correct updating (vs. incorrect updating) of the candidate preference as measured by the questionnaires in between and at the end. 
Hypo 3: measurement of affective intelligence via questionnaire: (i) difficulty of vote choice, (ii) certainty of having chosen the “right” candidate, (iii) Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) to assess subject’s affective state. Up to the tipping point, the reported difficulty increases and confidence decreases, beyond the tipping point it is the reverse. Individuals who had a greater probability of encountering negative information have more negative affective state after casting vote than control group who received no negative information.

============================================================================

The Background: Motivated reasoning tells us that even when people encounter information contrary to their prior beliefs, they maintain their current beliefs. Sometimes they even assert their current beliefs more strongly and basically “reason” away the contrary information.

The Question: Do motivated reasoners ever give up and change with contrary information?

The Theory: They post that with a small amount of contrary information motivated reasoning will hold, but when subjects see larger amounts of negative information (i.e. information contradicting their viewpoint) they will begin to get anxious. Anxiety will lead them to more information seeking and more careful processing. This will lead to opinion change.

The Method: They use the information board, which simulates a campaign environment. They vary the amounts of contradictory information subjects are exposed to.

Findings: They track exposure (i.e. the percentage of contrary information subjects could have clicked on) and actual viewing (how much information they actually read/saw). The percentage of contrary information viewed before changes is relatively lower- like 20%.

Critical Thoughts: This doesn’t contradict motivated reasoning. In fact it can be viewed as just further exploring the online tally. There are potential issues with the external/internal validity of the information board – i.e. they don’t control who clicks what and not everyone is a motivated reasoner, but that is a minor issue (subjects didn’t know before clicking whether an article would be agreeing or contradictory, which also helps). The anxiety part of the theory relies on affective intelligence and other papers like Valentino et. al 2008 (see cognition notes) that posit that anxiety actually promotes information seeking and efficient information processing, but this view is contested. Anxiety might motivate information seeking, but in some studies it inhibits processing (Huddy et. al 2005). At the same time, the anxiety “link” in the theory isn’t essential to the findings.},

However, the methods used in previous efforts have made it difficult to untangle the various causal pathways that might link emotions to political beliefs. In contrast, we focus on emotions incidental (i.e., irrelevant) to the decision process, allowing us to cleanly trace and estimate the effect of experimentally-induced anxiety on political beliefs. Further, we build upon innovative new work that links physiological reactivity (Oxley et al., 2008a; Hatemi et al., 2013) to attitudes by using skin conductance reactivity as a measure of emotional arousal. We found that anxiety ï¿½ generated by a video stimulus ï¿½significantly affected physiological arousal as measured by tonic skin conductance levels, and that higher physiological reactivity predicted more anti-immigration attitudes. We show that physiological reactivity mediated the relationship between anxiety and political attitudes.},
  comment   = {Overview:
- incidental emotion (not related to politics) -> manipulation of anxiety
- effect of (induced incidental) anxiety affected attitudes towards immigration 
-> does not use self-reported anxiety (which is very likely to be confounded by political content etc.)!
-> finding: diffuse anxiety affects policy preferences/attitudes towards immigration

Question: 
next study: what about the causal mechanism
-> do people in a state of anxiety focus on different aspects? do they process information differently?

=> overall an interesting article, makes some good points about causal investigations etc.},

We present an alternative, semiautomated approach, the structural topic model (STM) (Roberts, Stewart, and Airoldi 2013; Roberts et al. 2013), that draws on recent developments in machine learning based analysis of textual data. A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the STM is helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects. We illustrate these innovations with analysis of text from surveys and experiments.},

First, is dual accountability operational across decentralized countries, or do sub-national voters turn to national cues as a means to economize in a complex information environment? By bringing a cross-national dataset to bear on this question, we are able to provide insight into where and why dual accountability might operate. Second, what explains variation in the extent to which party systems are nationalized across countries and time? We build on previous literature to suggest a number of factors likely to impact the extent of nationalization. We examine those factors in the context of provincial-level elections in Argentina, Canada, Germany and the United States. Using national and sub-national economic data, we find little evidence of dual accountability in any of our countries. We find that economic performance matters little for regional electoral outcomes, and where it does, sub-national outcomes reflect national rather than sub-national conditions. More important are the roles of partisan relations across levels of government and election timing. Sub-national co-partisans of the nationally governing party lose votes, particularly as the time from the most recent national election grows. The strength of these effects varies across our cases in predictable ways.},

  comment   = {- Q: why weren't the democrats able to pass more legislation given the fact that they were in control of the House for a long time 
- realignment of electoral forces led to reduction of sectional divisions within the parties
- as parties became more homogenous, the parties were able to reform house rules 
- house reforms (1971-1975): end of seniority system to appoint committee chairs (they decide which legislation is passed from the committees to the floor) 
-> seniority system: members of a committee who have been in there the longest time are named committee chairs, and only they decide what gets to the floor... 
- 1975: democrats very strong, mid-term election after Watergate
- now: you can't be committee chair if you are not aligned with you party -> less incentive to stay with the party to increase your seniority

Summary:
Conditional party government (CPG) states that majority party delegates more power to party leaders when preferences vary less within each party and more between parties. Parties are stronger when there is less internal diversity and more ideological difference between parties. CPG claims that increased internal homogeneity allows leaders to have more power, thus through agenda setting the majority party has more power and influence on legislation.},

This article reviews 14 recent cross-national econometric studies, and many qualitative studies, that cast light on the relationship between natural resources and civil war. It suggests that collectively they imply four underlying regularities: first, oil increases the likelihood of conflict, particularly separatist conflict; second, `lootable' commodities like gemstones and drugs do not make conflict more likely to begin, but they tend to lengthen existing conflicts; third, there is no apparent link between legal agricultural commodities and civil war; and finally, the association between primary commodities - a broad category that includes both oil and agricultural goods - and the onset of civil war is not robust. The first section discusses the evidence for these four regularities and examines some theoretical arguments that could explain them. The second section suggests that some of the remaining inconsistencies among the econometric studies may be caused by differences in the ways they code civil wars and cope with missing data. The third section highlights some further aspects of the resourcc-civil war relationship that remain poorly understood.},

First, the likelihood of civil war in countries that produce oil, gas, and diamonds rose sharply from the early 1970s to the late 1990s; so did the number of rebel groups that sold contraband to raise money. Second, exogenous measures of oil, gas, and diamond wealth are robustly correlated with the onset of civil war. Still, these correlations are based on a small number of cases, and the substantive effects of resource wealth are sensitive to certain assumptions. Third, petroleum and diamond production lead to civil wars through at least three different mechanisms. Finally, the only resource variable robustly linked to conflict duration is a measure of ``Contraband,{''} which includes gemstones, timber, and narcotics.},

- Both expected-utility theory and prospect theory assume that the impact of a given probability is a function of that probability but not of the outcome to which it is attached (psychophysical approach) 
- The affective approach draws a distinction between monetary and affective determinants of value. Although probability-outcome independence may hold across outcomes having different monetary values, the affective approach implies that it is unlikely to hold across outcomes having different affective values
- If the shape of the weighting function is influenced by affective reactions, then the weighting function will be more S-shaped for lotteries involving affect-rich outcomes than for lotteries involving affect poor outcomes (holding the monetary values of the outcomes constant).
- When a positive outcome is available, any departure from impossibility may engender hope or some similar affect, and any deviation from certainty may produce fear or some similar affect. 
- When the available outcome is negative, departures from impossibility should engender fear, and deviations from certainty should produce hope.

- author argues that moral conviction should be conceptualized as a dimension of attitude strength
- distinction b/w moral and non-moral issues is not reasonable, even non-moral issues such as economic considerations are 
- moral convictions shape political attitudes and opinions, there is variance across and within issues
-> moral conviction as right-wrong distinction: you believe that what someone else is wrong (e.g. eating brussel sprouts [non-moral] vs. cleaning with an American flag [moral])
- definition of moral conviction: absolute universal standard, experienced as objective, independent of external authority
- propensity to moralize or moral conviction is related to political participation, extreme political attitudes, arousal of negative emotions, and hostility

studies/analyses:
1) moral conviction and emotions:
- two convenience samples (students and MTurk)
- hypotheses/results: moral conviction varies across + within issues, includes economic and noneconomic issues, is associated with arousal of negative emotions (more than other aspects such as attitude strength)
- Rs reported attitudes on specific policy issues as well as the degree to which moral considerations play a role in forming attitude
- correlations with other measures of attitude strength are only moderate (!)
2) effects of moral conviction
- previous datasets + ANES Evaluations of Government and Society Study (EGSS) -> interesting dataset!
- hypotheses/results: confirmation of previous results (as far as possible, moral conviction increases political participation
- moral conviction is also related to partisanship (U-shaped) and one-sided political evaluations + blame attribution

questions/comments:
- what about the issue differences? idea: multilevel model taking into account issue differences and individual differences
- causal direction?
- interesting: moral conviction does not require citizens to derive attitudes through logical reasoning -> does not necessarily lead to belief constraint
- interesting argument: think about moral conviction as a dimension of attitude strength!
- why should economics not be considered a moral issue? moral foundations theory would argue otherwise!
- relvance of moral concerns is self-reported, it would be interesting to look at moral considerations in a more unobtrusive vontext -> people might want to be perceived to be opinionated
- what about elite rhetoric as a determinant of moralization?},

That literature has treated civil war as an aggregate category and has nor considered if identity (ethnic/religious) wars have different causes than nonidentity wars. The author argues that this is an important distinction and that identity wars are due predominantly to political grievance rather than lack of economic opportunity. Ethnic heterogeneity is also associated differently with identity than nonidentity wars. Some systemic variables are also important determinants of civil war, and these have been neglected in the existing literature. An important new result is that living in a bad neighborhood, with undemocratic neighbors or neighbors at war, significantly increases a country's risk of experiencing ethnic civil war.},

The intent of the change to a nonpartisan format was, and still is, to remove party cues from a voter's decision, thereby causing the voter to seek out other information about a candidate. This study seeks to examine the effects of nonpartisan elections on patterns of voter decisionmaking. We examine the structure of electoral choice in partisan and nonpartisan elections at the state and local levels using paired comparisons and interrupted time series. Using precinct and district level voting data, we compare mayoral races in the sister cities of Champaign and Urbana (IL) and state legislative elections in Nebraska and Kansas. In addition, we examine the city of Asheville (NC) during its change from partisan to nonpartisan elections in the early 1990s and state legislative elections in Minnesota during its change from nonpartisan to partisan contests in the early 1970s. The analysis of these cases helps us to understand the effects of removing party identification from the ballot. We find that nonpartisanship depresses turnout and that in nonpartisan contests voters rely less on party and more on incumbency in their voting decisions. The nonpartisan ballot "works" but how one evaluates the results depends on one's view of the electorate and the purpose of elections.},

In this article, we attempt to gain a better understanding of this effect by comparing the survey responses of vote-choice questions that provide party labels and those that do not. We show that less educated survey respondents are substantially less likely to express a vote preference when party labels are not available to them. In addition, we also find evidence that those who can state a vote intention in nonpartisan races are less able to link their candidate choice to their party identification. We conclude by demonstrating that, when surveys do not provide partisan cues, the small number of respondents who are willing to state their vote intentions and the large number of those who appear to be guessing create great difficulties for pollsters trying to predict election results.},

  abstract  = {When a 30-year decline in the American voters' trust of political office holders and the election process is contrasted to their enduring trust of the democratic form of government, there is strong confirmation of the need to take a multidimensional approach in measuring political trust. To. this end, a segmentation scheme based on two well-established political trust measures (i.e., incumbent-based trust and regime-based trust) is proposed. In particular how two specific trust segments differ in terms of the time they spend on various political and election-related activities is examined. Among other things, the findings reveal that the dual-trusting segment (i.e., those who were regime trusting and incumbent untrusting) to watch television debates or speeches and have informal discussions with friends and co-workers on topics related to the election. There were no meaningful differences between the two segments when it came to giving or raising funds, or campaigning for a candidate or political party. However, when it came to voting-related decision making, the results suggest that dual-trusting individuals were significantly more likely to spend more than a little time considering how they were going to vote for President, U.S. Senate, and on particular political issues. The article ends with suggestions for future research, as well as some thoughts on how politicians and their advisers might more fully embrace the relational marketing paradigm, especially as it pertains to the connection between elected officials and the voting public.

  comment   = {Question: How do parties organize and maintain themselves?

Contributions: Mostly theoretical:
Parties primarily work to win elections. Voters exchange votes for policies, which is similar to a market mechanism. Since the benefits of parties are to some extant public goods (ie brand names, increasing awareness mobilizing voters) this creates problems as parties are market oriented institutions. Therefore they need to compensate workers to create the public goods. Some of this is done through patronage jobs (or the promise of patronage jobs). Also need volunteers to generate the public goods. This tension shifts the party around. Sometimes the need to compensate increases and it becomes more corrupt, other times party needs to win and cleans house. (Maybe red queen stuff from cooperation can be used here to explain cycles in politics).

Summary:
Downs explains party competition but not party organization. The article here explains party organization much like that of a business and/or interest group. First, the party maintains itself through market-exchange, making it more like a business than a public good. Second, the party’s output consists of collective goods, which makes it more like a public service than a business. Third, the party compensates its members indirectly (committee appointments, etc.) making it similar to an interest group and unlike a business. This article supports Downs basic theory that “parties formulate policies in order to win elections, rather than win elections to formulate policies”. In other words, market goals (policies, electoral consequences, etc.) dominate organizations sustained by a market (e.g., parties) and create structure within the organization. The key to party resilience lies in its unique combination of market base organization (private goods) with outputs consisting of collective goods (public goods).},

- paper argues that both, immigrant group size as well as negative immigration-related news reports affect perceived group threat
- group size is hypothesized to interact with news reports in both directions (two competing theoretical explanations)

study/analyses:
- repeated cross-sectional survey in spain, 1996-2007
- multilevel model looking at individual as well as contextual effects (group size + media reports)

main results:
- larger immigrant group size increases perceived group threat
- larger number of negative news reports increase perceived group threat
- effect of news reports is larger for small immigrant group size -> less direct experience, more reliance on media

questions/comments:
- variables measuring group threat focus on cultural threat, less on economic threat
- what about changing slopes for individual factors depeding on region and time?
- hypothesized positive and negative interaction could be moderated by individual-level factors
- different individuals use different media sources, therefore diverging perceptions of immigrant threat (elective exposure)},

The experiments were inspired by the model of Schram and Van Winden (1991). In the model, individuals favoring the same policy or candidate are members of a common reference group, and the vote decision is determined by inter- and intragroup relations. Our experimental data supported three hypotheses derived from this model. First, participation increased with group identity. Second, communication enhanced participation. Finally, participation was strongly related to individual characteristics. A simple analysis of the way people learn from their experiences in previous periods is used to argue that any model of voter turnout should take account of myopic adaptive behavior and inertia.},

- liberal and conservatives exhibit different cognitive styles, have different brain structure (gray matter volume in amygdala...) etc.
- this study looks at differences in brain function in liberals and conservatives

method:
- fMRI of respondents who participated in a simpe risk-taking task
- matching with public voting records to compare liberals and conservatives

results:
- dem and reps did not differ significantly in risk-taking behavior
- but: dems showed greater activity in left insula, while republicans showed greater activity in right amygdala
=> These results suggest that liberals and conservatives engage different cognitive processes when they think about risk, and they support recent evidence that conservatives show greater sensitivity to threatening stimuli.

summary:
- Subjects participated in a risk-taking task and brain acitivyt was monitored. A different part of the brain was activated when Democrats made risky behavior than when Republicans chose risky behavior. 
- The democrat region is related to regulating and monitoring how the risky response wll make them feel internally.
- The republican region is related to monitoring external consequences of behavior so the responses is dealing with tangible potential external consequences. 
- Republicans are more sensitive to external conflict while Democrats are more sensitive to internal conflict. 
- The processes of evaluation are distinct for lib and cons perhaps leading to different value priorities and different political preferences. 

comments:
- result is interesting because it suggests that biological factors not only affect the sets of values (see previous research), but that the neural processes themselves are distinct!
- what about causal mechanism? no controls for other factors such as personality etc?},

Values (1) are concepts or beliefs, (2) pertain to desirable end states or behaviors, (3) transcend specific situations, (4) guide selection or evaluation of behavior and events, and (5) are ordered by relative importance.

3 universal requirements of human existence: 
needs of individuals as biological organisms, requisites of coordinated social interaction, and survival and welfare needs of groups

10 motivationally distinct value types 
-> recognized within and across cultures, comprehensive: self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, confirmity, tradition, benevolence, universalism (+ spirituality)

Empirical results: 
- evidence from 20 countries: meaning of value types and single values is largely equivalent across most groups 
- 2 basic dimensions that organize value system: -> integrated motivational structure 
1) self-transcendence vs. self-enhancement 
2) openness to change vs. conservation

Q: how does this definition of values allow for a clear differentiation from ideology? -> check previous definitions of ideology

summary:
- Values are: concepts or beliefs; pertain to desirable end states or behaviors; transcend specific situations; guide selection or evaluation of behavior or events; ordered by relative importance
- “primary content aspect of a value is the type of goal or motivational concern that it expresses” of which there are three:
1) needs of individuals as biological organisms
2) requisites of coordinated social interaction
3) survival and welfare needs of groups
- Value types: self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity, tradition, spirituality (this one didn’t show up), benevolence, universalism
- It can be characterized with a two-dimensional model with one dimension of self-transcendence vs. self-enhancement and the other dimension openness to change vs. conservation.
- These value structures apply across different cultures even if different cultures put different emphases on certain values.},

Existing studies to date have been inconclusive, focusing only on single-cleavage characteristics of social structure, such as ethnic or religious fractionalization. This study argues that models that do not take into account the relationship between cleavages (or cleavage structure) are biased and thus reach faulty conclusions. With the focus on the cleavages of ethnicity and religion, the effects of two characteristics of cleavage structure on civil war onset (cross-cuttingness and cross-fragmentation) are defined and tested. A new index of ethno-religious cross-cuttingness (ERC), derived from national public opinion surveys, reveals that ERC is a significant determinant of civil war onset when interacted with ethnic fractionalization.},

In this paper, I define and measure three multidimensional characteristics of social structure-cross-cuttingness, cross-fractionalization, and subgroup fractionalization-and present a new cross-national data set comprised of indices along combinations of five cleavages: race, language, religion, region, and income. After addressing important definitional and measurement issues, I discuss the data and show how their inclusion in economic growth regressions reopens the theoretical debate regarding the influence of ethnic diversity, indicating the potential for these new indices to shed light on the role of ethnic diversity (and social structure more generally) with regards to a number of phenomena of concern to political scientists.

- Peikes et al. study compared propensity score matching to benchmark
- authors argue that this benchmark test is insufficient

rejection of ideal test for matching:
1) randomized experiment has to be well executed
2) the observational study has to be well done (to get at potential rather than robustness of method) -> balance and strong ignorability
3) no 3rd confounding variable (geographical location)
4) experiment and nonexperiment should have the same estimator -> LATE vs. ATT: same quantities, but rely on different assumptions (IV is problematic...)
5) analysts of observational data should be blind to the result of the randomized experiment
6) standards in the comparison of both estimates -> expectations too high, implied perfect power 

conclusion about matching criteria described in Peikes et al.:
- many variables not sufficient if selection variables are missing
- large samle size is not enough if they are drawn from different regions etc,
- high non-compliance is problematic (weak instrument etc.)
- matching protocol was suboptimal, balance not well-tested
- estimates from experimental methods can be problematic if assumptions for experimental estimation are violated
- balance is not sufficient to meet the critical strong ignorability assumption

conclusion:
- the study was not an ideal test for matching, several criteria do not hold etc...
- "In summary, the PMO study did neither an ideal job of propensity score analysis, nor an ideal job of comparing experimental and PSM estimates."

comment:
- seems to me that the authors argue something like: if all assumptions of matching were met, then we wouldn't have a problem},

- looks at relationship b/w political ideology, exploratory behavior, and formation of attitudes 
- experimental game environment -> select good and bad beans, only gather information if bean is selected 
- theoretical background: approach and avoidance, conservatives have higher fear of the unknown/threats and therefore more avoidant

results: 
- more conservative participants approached fewer beans during the game -> more cautious strategy 
- ideology did not relate to overall learning, but: more conservative participants exhibited a larger difference in their learning of the negative versus positive beans (in favor of the negative) -> learning asymmetry

questions: 
- what is the causal direction here? could be either way, right? 
- minor: no blocking on ideology variables (I guess that's fine) 
- Q: how does all this relate to motivated reasoning? and what about risk aversity?

theoretical argument:
- authoritarian personality approach + dual-process motivational approach
- RWA/SDO as ideological attitudes rather than personality dimension
- SDO related to tough-mindedness, RWA related to social conformity, therefore both are connected to different personality dimensions

- theoretical description/introduction to social dominance theory and social dominance orientation

trimorphic structure of group-based social hierarchies
- age system, gender system, arbitrary-set system
-> arbitrary sets: socially constucted, highly salient groups, coincides with availability of economic surplus

basic assumptions of social dominance theory:
1) age- and gender-based hierarchies exist within all social systems, arbitrary-set hierarchies emerge when societies produce sustainable economic surplus
2) most forms of group suppression are manifestations of basic human predispositions to form group-based social hierarchies
3) counterabalancing influences of hierarchy-enhancing (HE) forces and hierarchy attenuating (HA) forces

processes driving group-based social hierarchies:
- aggregated individual discrimination
- aggregated institutional discrimination -> disproportionate allocation of social values + systematic terror (official, semiofficial, unofficial)
- behavioral asymmetry -> asymmetrical ingroup bias, outgroup favoritism, self-delibitation, ideological asymmetry

legitimizing myths (LMs):
- values, beliefs, ideologies, stereotypes
- can be HE or HA, differ by consensuality, embeddedness, certainty, mediational strength

nature of social dominance orientation:
- degree to which individuals desire and support group-based social hierarchy
- affected by: group membership/identification, socialization, personality factors/empathy, gender

- subordinate males as primary object of arbitrary-set discrimination

- equilibrium of HA and HE forces

  pages     = {476},
  volume    = {70},
  comment   = {Disclaimer: Very fundamental piece, go to Discussion section in the paper for more info.

There are two important theories that brought up:
a) Principled conservatism (Glazer 1975; Jacoby 1994; Sniderman et al. 1991) model make three claims about the racial attitudes of White Americans: (1) political conservatism is orthogonal to classical racism; (2) conservatism might be associated with racism among the intellectually unsophisticated, weakly or not at all correlated for intellectually sophisticated; (3) conservative opposition to social policy (affirmative action, etc.), is not driven by political values that are independent of racism of desire for group dominance; (4) the unique contribution of political conservatism to racial policy attitudes should increase as a function of increasing educational sophistication. 
b) The general dominance paradigm (SDO – Sidanius 1993), realistic conflict – Jackman 1991, etc. ) says that (1) political conservatism and racism are not orthogonal to one another but rather share a common core concerning the desire to establish unequal and hierarchical relationships among groups; (2) the relationship between racism and political conservatism will increase as a function of increasing intellectual sophistication; (3) whereas political conservatism may influence opposition to affirmative action independently of classical racism or group dominance drives, the effect of these latter factors on affirmative action attitudes will nevertheless increase rather than decrease as people become more intellectually sophisticated. 

Authors use 3 survey experiments and find that (1) the relationships between political conservatism and racism generally increased as a function of educational sophistication; however, the relationship between political conservatism and anti-Black affect did not increase with educational sophistication, (2) The correlation between political conservatism and racism could be entirely accounted for by their mutual relationship with social dominance orientation – the cores of both belief systems lies an opposition to group equality, and the endorsement of hierarchical group relations, (3) the net effect of political conservatism, racism, and social dominance orientation on opposition to social policy (affirmative action) increased with increasing education. 

Comments: 
Converse (1964) would say both social dominance and principled conservatism theorists assume that better educated people have a more well-understood, enriched, and constrained set of political attitudes than the less well-educated and that’s what both theories assume. In this study, the main point is that the principled conservatism proposition that the relationship between political conservatism and affirmative action, on the one hand, and racism, on the other hand, dissipates with increasing intellectual sophistication was clearly not supported.},

This paper poses an experimental test of the leading explanations for the surprisingly weak showing of pocketbook influences on vote choice. According to certain of these explanations, the answer lies in distinguishing between sociotropic and self-interested economic voting, or between retrospective and prospective economic voting, or between perceptions of economic trends in general and perceptions of the electorally relevant component of these trends. However, expectations based on these explanations are generally not borne out in the laboratory setting. Consistent with the observed pattern of effects, however, is the idea that pocketbook voting displays little independent impact because economic perceptions and attributions are epiphenomena - strongly biased by the voter's preexisting political commitments.},

  comment   = {overview:
- argues that global rationality has to be revised 
- rational behavior that is compatible with the access to information and computational capcities of humans 
- characteristics of the decision-maker vs. characteristics of his environment --> paper concentrates on choosing organism 
- short discussion of classical rational choice concept -> too complicated for humans 
-> 2 main points: satisficing strategies + constrained processing capacities/bounded rationality 

possible simplifications/changes: 
1) simple pay-off functions [discontinuous, step-function]--> satisfactory outcomes 
2) information gathering --> costly 
3) vector payoff function instead of scalar --> e.g. incomparability of different concerns 

Introducing dynamics: sequential examination of alternatives 
1) aspiration level as function of search length 
2) change of the set of alternatives the person actually considers 
3) payoffs might depend on alternatives chosen in previous trials 

-> "The aim of this paper has been to construct definitions of "rational choice" that are modeled more closely upon the actual decision processes in the behavior of organisms than definitions heretofore proposed. We have outlined a fairly complete model for the static case, and have described one extension of this model into dynamics. [...] The broader aim, however, in constructing these definitions of "approximate" rationality is to provide some materials for the construction of a theory of the behavior of a human individual or of groups of individuals who are making decisions in an organizational context."

Modifications to rational choice:
- Simple payoff structures – simple cutoff point
- Information gathering – not costless, one decision to be made is how much to invest in information gathering
- Aspiration levels can change during the decision making process – if easy to find something that satisfies an aspiration level than move it up.},

  comment   = {overview:
- attitudes held with strong moral conviction have different interpersonal consequences than strong but non-moral attitudes
- moral conviction leads to greater preferred social and physical distance from attitudinaly dissimilar others, lower levels of good will and cooperativeness in attitudinally heterogeneous groups, as well as greater inability to generate procedural solutions to resolve disagreements.

dimensions of attitude strength:
- extremeity, importance, certainty, centrality, accessibility
- moral conviction is different from all those factors, because of its "(a) universalism; (b) status of moral beliefs as factual belief, compelling motive, and justification for action; and (c) emotion

study results:
- study 1: questionnaire asking about most important issue, moral conviction on that issue is correlated with desired social distance
- study 2: questionnaire asking about different issues, moral conviction is correlated with distance, but now they control for generalized tendency to feel that attitudes are rooted in moral conviction
- study 3: behavioral measure of preferred physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar other (chair placement next to confederate who is believed to hold different position)
- study 4: group discussion experiment, varying group composition (heterogeneity), moral mandates, multiple outcome measures such as whether the group came to agrrement about decision procedure, how they evaluated cooperativeness etc.

comments:
- study 4 could be interesting from a design perspective since it consists of a group discussion experiment
- paper has some useful cites, especially regarding theoretical literature review; it also discusses the difference between general values and issue-specific application of moral convictions
- I think the empirical evidence is rather weak, moral conviction is never really manipulated, so none of the studies are actual eperiments
- many garden of forking paths problems, conceptualization of attitude strength differs b/w some studies without clear explanation, especially the sample selection in study 4 seems arbitrary, general issues with statistical approaches},

To investigate these competing hypotheses for party effects on voter decision making, participants were presented with a choice between 2 candidates whose policy positions were more inconsistent than consistent with their party identification (Study 1), or completely inconsistent with their party identification (Study 2). People voted as a function of party label in Study I, but issue stand emerged as a stronger predictor in Study 2 (although Democrats were more likely to cross party lines than Republicans). These results suggest that party identification influences how other information about the candidate is perceived and processed. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Despite their potential importance, little is known about the nature and prevalence of party identification dynamics within American presidential campaigns. This study reviews existing research to propose three basic contrasting models. It then introduces multivariate state space methods that account for sampling error and survey design effects to evaluate each modelï¿½s relative support within daily national survey data of the 1984, 2000, 2004, and 2008 presidential campaigns. The results indicate that the balance of party identifiers had near-certain changes during three of the four campaigns, with campaign events often being associated with these changes. These findings suggest that polls and analyses that fail to allow for sudden shifts in party identifications will mask changes in public opinion. More generally, the findings demonstrate that campaigns shape party coalitions on Election Day, and possibly thereafter.},

- party identification dynamics during election campaign -> effect of campaigns on party identification
- multivariate state-space methods to correct for sampling error and survey design effects

- tests proposition of MFT, which states that political attitudes are rooted in instinctual evaluations generated by innate psychological modules evolved to solve social dilemmas
- "find substantial variability in individual-level moral foundations across time, and little evidence that these changes account for changes in political attitudes. We also find little evidence that moral foundations are heritable"
-> findings raise questions about the future of MFT as a theory of ideology

data:
- 2 overlapping (panel) twin study samples (Australia)
- 4 US replication samples

implicit assumptions of MFT tested by the authors:
1) moral foundations are stable traits -> moral foundations are not particularly stable over time, and especially less stable than political ideology
2) changes in moral foundations will predict changes in political attitudes -> ideology has slightly greater causal influence on moral foundations than vice versa, but their empirical evidence backing this claim is rather weak
3) moral foundations are heritable -> no evidence that moral foundations are heritable, while political ideology is indeed shown to be heritable in the same sample

conclusion:
- "Put simply, our findings run contrary to assumptions underpinning MFT as a theory of ideology. The obvious inference from our analysis is either that moral value systems are not innate or that MFQ items and instruments are not validly and reliably tapping into such innate systems"
- "our findings are consistent with the notion of moral foundations being highly responsive to context: more of a state than a trait"
- "It may also be that individuals choose or evoke moral foundations as reasons to justify their predisposed ideological values"
- "it suggests MFQs tap into a contextualized more than a dispositional dimension of personality"


question/comments:
- the reason for MFT to be less stable than ideology could also be due to measurement error or other issues
- some of the analyses seem to stack the cards heavily against MFT},

not only situational cues determine an attitude as in social constructivist Zaller model, but also predispositions. The influence of predispositions is not so minimal. They don’t believe in what they call the “Curvlinear-ambivalence hypothesis”: those with a lot of “+” considerations are likely to have overall “+” in most situations and those with many “–“ considerations are likely to end up overall “–“, those with mixed considerations are more ambivalent and have less predispositions. (“Predisposition” is defined as the degree of consistency of “+” or “–“ considerations. [similar to deduction 5 in Zaller and Feldman, right?]. Rather, they believe in the additivity or interaction hypothesis: situation and predisposition do not matter complementary (either the predisposition matters when many “+” or “–“ or situation matters when mixed), but additive or even interactive. Both matter together jointly. One matters because the other matters. They content that individuals are approximately rational in that they use their predispositions and the information they are provided for (the frame) and update the former with the latter. They are neither blind to the past (their disposition) or the present (situation). 

Method: 
in framing experiments they show that people either draw upon both cues (predisposition and situation) at the same time.},

We estimate a multi-level voting process where individuals face a participation decision (whether to vote or abstain) and a voting decision (whether to vote strategically for a likely winner party or as communicating for a sure loser party). Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, individuals who are either independent or uninformed are less likely to turnout. However, being both independent and uninformed does not have any statistically significant effect on electoral participation. Thus, our results question the empirical relevance of the swing voter's curse theory in large elections. Second, the probability of voting as communicating is positively related with the level of education and the degree of dissatisfaction with the political system. Finally, political preferences and institutional features characterizing the functioning of the political system and of the media market have a significant effect both on electoral participation and on the voting decision.

Recent research, however, seems to have concentrated on the rebels and their motivations to the exclusion of how the state can affect the onset and outcome of civil wars. This special issue addresses this lacuna by looking at the role of state capacity. In particular, state capacity is a multi-dimensional concept that encompasses not only the extractive abilities of a state but also economic development and bureaucratic quality. Despite the various ways in which state capacity can be measured, the articles clearly show that strong states have a decreased risk of experiencing a civil war, although there is evidence that civil violence decreases state capacity, implying a reverse causality. In addition, it appears that the capable states that do experience civil violence are more able to credibly commit to a negotiated solution, which increases the possibility of a bargained end to the violence. While these articles do not represent the last word on the subject, they do provide convincing evidence that state capacity plays a critical role in the onset and conduct of civil violence.},

We split civil wars into those where the rebels simply want to remove the government (replacement) from those where the rebels want to alter the relationship between the state and society (legitimacy). Theoretically, states are most at risk for a civil war of replacement when they extract substantial wealth from society and the government is weak. In contrast, civil wars of legitimacy are more likely to occur in states where the rebels have both grievances and a means to maintain their future viability. An empirical analysis of civil wars of replacement and legitimacy from 1960 to 1999 confirms both our argument about the different types of civil violence and their differing causes.},

Through their experiences under a given policy design, welfare clients develop program-specific beliefs about the wisdom and efficacy of asserting themselves. Because clients interpret their experiences with welfare bureaucracies as evidence of how government works more generally beliefs about the welfare agency and client involvement become the basis for broader political orientations I conclude that the views of government that citizens develop through program participation help explain broader patterns of political action and quiescence.},

In the 1990s, ``progressive revisionists{''} argued that, by reforming welfare, liberals could free the Democratic Party of a significant electoral liability, reduce the race-coding of poverty politics, and produce a public more willing to invest in anti-poverty efforts. Connecting this argument to recent scholarship on policy feedback, we pursue a quantitative case study of the potential for new policies to move public opinion. Our analysis reveals that welfare reform in the 1990s produced few changes in mass opinion. To explain this result, we propose a general framework for the analysis of mass feedback effects. After locating welfare as a ``distant-visible{''} case in this framework, we advance four general propositions that shed light on our case-specific findings as well as the general conditions under which mass feedback effects should be viewed as more or less likely.},

  abstract  = {The existing literature identifies natural resource wealth as a major determinant of civil war. The dominant causal link is that resources provide finance and motive (the ``looting rebels{''} model). Others see natural resources as causing ``political Dutch disease,{''} which in turn weakens state caljacity (the ``state capacity{''} model). In the looting rebels model, resource wealth first increases, but then decreases the risk for civil war as very large wealth enables governments to constrain rebels, whereas in the state capacity model, large resource wealth is unambiguously related to higher risk of war, This research note uses a new dataset on natural resource rents that are disaggregated as mineral and energy rents for addressing the resources-conflict relationship. We find that neither a dummy variable for major oil exporters nor out, resource rents variables predict civil war onset with a 1000-battle-death threshold coded by Fearon and Laitin (2003) in the period after 1970 for which rents data are available. However, using a lower threshold of 25 battle deaths, we find that energy wealth, but not mineral wealth, increases the risk for civil war onset. We find no evidence for a nonlinear relationship between either type of resources and civil war onset. The results tentatively support theories built around state capacity models and provide evidence against the looting rebels model of civil war onset.},

-> investigate voters' testosterone response to the outcome of the 2008 US presidential election
-> "The findings indicate that male voters exhibit biological responses to the realignment of a country's dominance hierarchy as if they participated in an interpersonal dominance contest."

Questions: 
- interesting finding regarding gender differences! is this an explanation for more general differences with regard to political behavior etc.? 
- very small sample size among males might be problematic 
- why is testosterone constant among women across both political orientations? what about circadian decline among women?
=> interesting finding, BUT: how does this drop in testosterone influence subsequent attitudes/behavior?},

Experiment 1:
- Participants (Ps) completed a ‘marketing study’ in which they evaluate food products
1) All Ps given cookies, half of Ps were given a glass of water after the cookies
2) All Ps completed a lexical decision task, half received thirst-related primes, half received neutral primes
3) All Ps completed a taste test of a mystery drink
4) Researchers measured the amount of liquid consumed as the DV [Multiple explicit measures of thirst in both Experiment 1 and 2 served as manipulation checks]
- Findings: Ps who were thirsty and received subliminal thirst primes consumed the most liquid. Ps who were primed with thirst words but were physically satiated drank nearly equally as much as those satiated Ps who were primed with neutral words. 

Experiment 2:
- Same pretense as Experiment 1
1) Ps asked to evaluate two sports drinks, SuperQuencher and PowerPro [Pilot studies confirmed SuperQuencher is generally perceived as more thirst quenching]
2) Half of Ps received thirst-related primes
3) Ps asked to select number of coupons for either sports drink
- Findings: Ps who received thirst-related primes were more favorable of SuperQuencher. Ps who received thirst-related primes asked for more SuperQuencher coupons than for PowerPro coupons. 
* Follow-up study also revealed a preference for SuperQuencher over PowerPro for both Ps who were subliminally primed with thirst words and for Ps who were supraliminally presented.

Experiment 3:
- Ps were told they would be completing a marketing study which also a decision making task. Half of Ps were told the decision making task would either be conducted alone or with another person.
1) Ps completed a lexical decision task, half received sad face primes
2) Ps were told to evaluate two CDs, Tweed Monkeys (which the ad claims will put you in a good mood) or Crystal Hammer (which the ad claims has a strong sound) [Pilot studies confirmed Tweed Monkeys CD was more likely to restore positive mood]
3) Ps were allowed seven songs total to listen to from either album
- Findings: Researchers found a significant three way interaction. Ps who received sad face primes (and hence lowered their positive mood [Mood measured implicitly through an evaluation of a sad piece of music, which seems questionable]) were more likely to rate Tweed Monkeys as more favorable only if they expected to interact with another person on the decision making task. Those Ps who received sad face primes but did not expect to interact with another person did not rate Tweed Monkeys as more favorable. Ps who received sad face primes and who expected to interact with someone also selected more Tweed Monkeys songs to listen to.

Take home message: Priming is not identical across situations. One needs the prime AND the motivation/outlet in order for the prime to have any meaningful impact. In other words, primes need to be accessible and applicable in order to have an influence on behavior.

Class discussion: The authors use this as evidence that individuals can be exploited by subliminal priming techniques. Agree?},

Using survey data gathered from a national sample before and after the opening of Fahrenheit 9/11, this study investigates the degree of selective exposure and the potential media effects occurring as a result of exposure to the film. The data provide evidence that selective exposure occurred ï¿½the audience for the film held more negative attitudes toward President George W. Bush. This study then turns to evaluating whether the film had political effects. Results suggest that those who viewed the film had significantly more negative attitudes toward Bush compared to those who intended to view the film, even after controlling for demographic, political, and media use differences between the groups. Results also suggest that political discussion with friends and family did not moderate the movie's effect, but that viewing the film may have inspired people to engage in more political discussion. Those viewing the film had higher levels of political discussion compared to those intending to view the film, even after controlling for a battery of other variables. Discussion of the results provides insight into the relationship between theories of media effects and selective exposure.},

Whether this is occurring, however, is a matter of debate. While some worry that people increasingly are seeking out likeminded views, others propose that newer media provide an increased opportunity for exposure to diverse views. In returning to the concept of selective exposure, this article argues that certain topics, such as politics, are more likely to inspire selective exposure and that research should investigate habitual media exposure patterns, as opposed to single exposure decisions. This study investigates whether different media types (newspapers, political talk radio, cable news, and Internet) are more likely to inspire selective exposure. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, evidence supports the idea that people's political beliefs are related to their media exposure - a pattern that persists across media types. Over-time analyses suggest that people's political beliefs motivate their media use patterns and that cable news audiences became increasingly politically divided over the course of the 2004 election.},

This study draws from research on how citizens process information to evaluate whether satirical versus serious news influences selective exposure. The analysis also examines whether exposure to satirical news affects partisan tolerance compared with serious news or no news at all. An experiment was conducted where participants were randomly assigned to view a comedic and satirical political Web site, a serious Web site, or no Web site. Respondentsï¿½ article selections were unobtrusively tracked. Results document that satirical news may lead people away from articles opposing their views and that it reduces tolerance for partisan views unlike oneï¿½s own.},

  comment   = {- critique of Haidt's moral foundations theory 
- argues that the theory is inadequate as a scientific account of morality 

- 3 major criticisms:

1) terminological and conceptual problems with innateness and modularity -> cannot support the theory 
- innateness as defined by Haidt is to loose, ease of learning is not a reliable marker of innateness 
- modularity is problematic (-> domain specificity and informational encapsulation questionable) 
-> Haidt's response: this critique is not directly directed at moral foundation theory, but rather about a general debate between nativist (modularity view) and empiricist (experience-based) perspective

2) number of moral foundations is problematic (ignores important cases)

- possible additional intuitions: industry and modesty 
- liberals also focus on purity/sanctity, although in different context (environment etc.) 
- problem of libertarians / multi-dimensional conceptualization of ideology 
-> Haidt's response: argued from the beginning that the approach is a starting point that needs refinement/revision, wants to add liberty/domination and wastefulness as potential additional factors; model is able to account for libertarians

3) mechanisms and categorical distinctions proposed by the theory are not consistent with findings from neuroscience 
- theoretical arguments of modularity, innateness, and informational encapsulation, domain specificity are not really backed by neuroscience and genetics 
- but: if there are Haidt-type mental modules, we should expect the orgariizaiion of the brain to reflect or, at an absolute minimum, be consistent with such modularity 
-> corresponding biological pattern as a necessary condition 
-> Haidt's response: that's an unrealistic requirement for a new theory, this strong connection can't be made at the current stage of neuroscientific and genetic research},

Three groups of voters (N=82)â€”Richard Nixon supporters, George McGovern supporters, and undecided participated in a 3-wave panel survey conducted (a) just before the Watergate hearings started, (b) midway through the hearings, and (c) just before the end of the hearings. Responses that reflected interest in and attention to Watergate-related matters gave support to both the selective approach and avoidance components of the selective exposure hypothesis: The Nixon supporters reported less interest in and attention paid to Watergate-related matters than did members of the other groups. Responses to questions that probed for general knowledge about Watergate committee matters complemented the selective exposure analyses: Nixon supporters appeared to know less about the committee proceedings than the undecideds or McGovern supporters. Analyses of behavioral intentions and evaluations of the attitude object illustrated the importance of studying selective exposure effects.

- experimental test of motivated reasoning hypothesis / framework -> explain why citizens are biased information-processors
- The authors describe and test numerous biases in information processing: prior attitude effect, disconfirmation bias, confirmation bias.
- These effects are thought to be most pronounced among sophisticates and those with strong attitudes.
- The outcome of motivated reasoning is attitude polarization. People who have been exposed to the same information become more extreme in either direction depending on predispositions.
- Two studies support the hypothesized relationships.

hypotheses:
- H1: a prior attitude effect, whereby people who feel strongly about an issue-even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside-will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than opposing arguments;
- H2: a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources denigrating and counterarguing attitudinally incongruent than congruent arguments; and 
- H3: a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to people will seek out confirming over disconfirming arguments. 
- H4: attitude polarization, whereby attitudes will become more extreme, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments. 
- H5: an attitude strength effect, such that those citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be most prone to motivated skepticism; and 
- H6: a sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable, because they possess greater ammunition with which to counterargue incongruent facts, figures, and arguments, will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.

experimental design:
- informatio boards
-> evaluation of strength of arguments
-> posterior attitudes
-> information search

questions/comments:
- Does motivated reasoning operate at system one or system two? Could it potentially work at both levels?
- Is motivated reasoning exclusive to on-line processing, or can it operate in memory based models, as well?
- If motivated reasoning is confined to sophisticates, is it really something we need to be worried about?},

Which decision strategies do voters use when evaluating and choosing candidates in a campaign context?

Approach & Method: 
Combination of simulation and experiment, investigation in how far the simulated predictions based on a set of decision rules predict evaluations and vote decisions in the experiment (contingent upon sophistication and level of information).

Results: 
The simulated decisions perform well in predicting actual evaluations and choices. High information load decrease the performance of complex decision rules. Furthermore, the decision rules perform better in predicting choices and evaluations of sophisticates.

overview:
- Compensatory rules outperform noncompensatory rules for candidate evaluation
- In high information environments, party identification performs reasonably well, some of the more complex decision rules (weighted additive, prospect theory, primacy) perform worse
- Modest evidence that information load affects the complex decision rules more than the simple ones
- Sophisticates outperform non-sophisticates. Mostly using the effortful rules (equal weighting, lexicographic, prospect theory, weighted additive). General rule is that sophisticates and non-sophisticates can use simple rules equally well. 
- Added value is that sophisticates perform better using more complicated rules, but better should be taken relatively because both sophisticates and non-sophisticates performed quite well.
- Find that voters may not need to be really well informed because they can use rules that perform reasonably well and take a short amount of time.},

- conceptualize a group as a collection of individuals who perceive themselves to be members of the same social category
- social categorization (also) serves as a system of orientation for self-reference -> social groups provide their members with an identification of themselves in social terms
- social identity: aspects of individual's self-image that derive from the social categories to which he believes himself as belonging

assumptions social identity theory:
1) individuals want to maintain or enhance self-esteem / positive self-concept
2) social groups are associated with positive or negative value connotations
3) evaluations of one own's group is determined with reference to specific other groups

derived theoretical principles:
- positive identity is based on favorable comparison to other groups
- when social identity is unsatisfactory, individuals will strive to leave their group or make the group more positively distinct
=> pressure to evaluate one own's group positively lead social groups to attempt to differentiate from each other

possible reactions to negative or threatened social identity:
1) individual mobility: move to out-group
2) social creativity: comparing on new dimension, changing the values assigned to the attributes of the group, changing the out-group with which the in-group is compared
3) social competition: positive distinctiveness through direct competition},

In this study, we show that liberals think WEIRDer than conservatives. In five studies with more than 3,000 participants, we found that liberals think more analytically (an element of WEIRD thought) than moderates and conservatives - even in China. We found that social liberals had more analytic perception in the framed-line task (Kitayama, Duffy, Kawamura, & Larsen, 2003) and categorized objects more analytically on the triad task, which asks participants to categorize a group of objects based on either abstract categories or intuitive relation (Ji, Zhang, & Nisbett, 2004). Social politics predicted thought style much better than economic and overall political identity. Studies 4 and 5 showed that briefly training people to think analytically made them form a more liberal opinion on welfare, whereas training them to think holistically made them form a more conservative opinion.},

- conservatives (in terms of social conservatism) engage in more holistic thinking, while liberals think more analytically 
- this makes sense, but what about economic dimension?

- manipulates analytical/holistic thinking -> more liberal/conservative views (in line with the hypotheses)

While they are critical aspects of conflict processes, perception of opportunity and grievance as two mutually competing explanations or separate categories ultimately can limit, rather than facilitate, our understanding of civil conflicts. For example, we show that not all motives can be designated easily as deriving from one or the other. In addition, the existing dichotomous framework masks other important questions about the way that collective action is achieved in some circumstances and not others or the way that some factors seem to generate grievances at one stage, perhaps, but then an opportunity at another or vice versa. Thus the priority should be to develop an integrated, comprehensive approach that can account for fundamental aspects of complex conflict processes. We conclude by providing suggestions for future research on civil conflict.},

This article analyses recent data from the British Social Attitudes survey to show that dissatisfaction in the flagship area of the National Health Service is associated with underprivilege rather than secure and rising standards of living. The implication is that the traditional defence of state welfare, as providing for those who experience needs which they find difficult to satisfy through the market, may still strike a chord with public opinion.},

Consistent with that hypothesis, racial attitudes had a significantly larger impact on health care opinions in fall 2009 than they had in cross-sectional surveys from the past two decades and in panel data collected before Obama became the face of the policy. Moreover, the experiments embedded in one of those reinterview surveys found health care policies were significantly more racialized when attributed to President Obama than they were when these same proposals were framed as President Clinton’s 1993 reform efforts."},

- 2 levels of analysis:
-> potential for connection between behavior-based theories of political psychology and cognition 
-> neural processes and systems involved in generating behaviors and states of mind.

fMRI basics:
- fMRI measures Blood Oxygen Dependent signal (BOLD) -> hemodynamic changes are closely related to neural activity
-> does not measure the underlying electric or chemical processes that make up brain function

ideal standard for fMRI usage in political psychology:
1) precisely articulated hyps regarding political behavior
2) identify clear hyp at level of neuronal activation
3) use experimental designs that isolate elements of theories
4) being clear about assumption in data analysis for fMRI

interesting points:
- inconcistencies of observed behavior and neuronal activity does not imply that models are misguided, should motivate refinements
- no clear hierarchy between neuronal level (neurobiological analysis) and behavioral (sociopsychological theories) level of analysis
- description of problem of reverse inference: existence of mental state cannot be inferred from pattern of brain activation (even though relationships are found in the other direction)
- assumption of modularity is very interesting and crucial! (check p. 37)

conclusion: research is required to (quote):
(1) greater acceptance of work more focused on presenting empirical results than on providing dispositive evidence in broader theoretical debates
(2) a commitment on the part of those conducting this research to refrain from overstating the definitiveness of its theoretical implications},

This is accomplished by moving the focus of the civil war literature away from an almost exclusive concern with the incentives of rebels to a consideration of both rebels and rulers as revenue seeking predators. This predatory theory approach expects that higher levels of state capacity should deter civil war onset, while civil war onset should reduce state capacity. Further, natural resource rents are expected to enhance state capacity, rather than increase the likelihood of civil war onset. In order to deal with the endogeneity posed by including fiscal measures of state capacity in single equation models of civil war onset, this study employs a simultaneous equations framework. This framework allows us to capture the effects of civil war onset on state capacity and vice versa, as well as the effects of primary commodities on both endogenous covariates. The main findings from the statistical analyses include: state capacity does not affect civil war onset, but civil war onset reduces state capacity; and primary products directly affect only state capacity - they do not directly affect civil war onset, as found in previous contributions to the literature.},

- foundation of lasso, minimizes the residual sum of squares subject tot the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant
- tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and therefore gives interpretable models (in contrast to ridge regression)
- tuning parameter can be chosen via k-fold cross-validation, standard errors can be obtained via bootstrap
- advantages over subset selection: more stable, better prediction accuracy
- advantages over ridge regression: ridge is more stable, but it doesn't reduce parameters to 0 which makes it less interpretable 
- the lasso can be conceptualized as a Bayes posterior mode under independent double-exponential priors for the beta_js.

comparison of methods based on simulations:
a) small number of large effects: subset selection does best, the lasso not quite as well and ridge regression does quite poorly
b) small to moderate number of moderate-sized effects: the lasso does best, followed by ridge regression and then subset selection
c) large number of small effects: ridge regression does best by a good margin, followed by the lasso and then subset selection

questions for Nick's application:
- data standardized?
- cross-validation to select tuning parameter?
- maybe ridge regression would be better because it performs better with a large number of small effects},

Hence, the electoral arena may give different people different degrees of political influence even when the formal equality of all citizens before the law is rigorously upheld in the electoral process. The first part of the paper explores the assumptions behind the proposition itself and the further assumptions that need to be made in order to test it empirically. The second part of the paper (forthcoming in the next issue of this periodical) offers an empirical test. Survey data on voting behavior in 18 democratic party systems from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and Larry Bartels' (1996) simulation procedure - now extended to the analysis of multiparty-systems, turnout effects and non-linear information effects on the vote - are utilized to explore the question. The results show that social differences in both turnout and political knowledge may lead to the hypothesized inequalities but their size is remarkably modest.},

  abstract  = {The paper empirically tests the proposition that because of the unequal social distribution of politically relevant resources, some groups of citizens may be less successful in expressing their specifically political preferences in the vote than others. Hence, the electoral arena may give different people different degrees of political influence even when the formal equality of all citizens before the law is rigorously upheld in the electoral process. The first part of the paper (published in the previous issue of this journal) explored the assumptions behind the proposition itself and the further assumptions that need to be made in order to test it empirically. The second part of the paper offers an empirical test. Survey data on voting behavior in 18 democratic party systems from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and Larry Bartels's (1996) simulation procedure - now extended to the analysis of multiparty-systems, turnout effects and non-linear information effects on the vote - are utilized to explore the question. The results show that social differences in both turnout and political knowledge may lead to the hypothesized political inequalities but their size is remarkably modest.},

summary:
- Ideology of the mass public is better fit with two dimensions.
- People who are cross-pressured on the two dimensions are more likely to identify as moderate. We can’t treat cross-pressured moderates the same as we treat actual moderates.},

- conservatism is fundamentally motivated by arousal (positive as well as negative) 
- previous findings that connected conservatism to negative stimuli were mostly confounded by the fact that negative stimuli were more arousing and positive stimuli not -> very interesting argument! 
- 2 mechanisms: 
1) arousal -> endorse conservatism to regulate emotion (-> cons are intolerant of emotional arousal) -> somehow cyclic argument... 
2) emotional arousal inhibits cognitive ability -> rely on gut-level rather than controlled cognitive processes -> conservatism 
=> "In sum, conservative ideology may be attractive to individuals who are in a state of arousal because it minimizes potential for further arousal and because it is intuitive."

Result: 
- participants agreed more with right-wing but not left-wing political speeches after being exposed positive/negative emotion inducing films

Questions: 
- regarding first mechanism: why should conservatism then be induced by arousal? -> I think their argument suggests that there is a moderating effect of ideology! 
- why doesn't arousal modulate agreement with left-wing political speeches?
=> Interesting: paper manipulates emotional arousal and looks at effect on political attitudes! the other papers mostly use observational/self-report measures (and do not manipulate emotions etc.) -> cleaner manipulations could make the argument stronger, e.g. using word lists etc.},

  comment   = {Main Argument:
Utility-based probabilistic choice processes (which introduce randomness in utility and/or decision rules) are ﬂawed since they assume independence from irrelevant alternatives (i.e. constant ratios between alternatives). The author presents a probabilistic theory of choice which is based on elimination-by-aspect in order to account for observed dependencies among alternatives.

Approach & Method:
Tversky derives testable consequences based on the theoretical formalization of the decision-process: Comparison of actual decision patterns in diﬀerent experimental tasks with the predictions of the constant-ratio model.

Results:
Constant-ratio model is valid for choice among unitary alternatives that are usually evaluated as wholes, but not for composite alternatives that tend to be evaluated in terms of their attributes or components.


=========================================================

Independence of irrelevant alternatives
- Cannot use the usual way of calculating alternatives because it harms the option that has been in the choice set
- Reconcile how people behave if they have similar alternatives with how we think about decision making processes

Elimination by aspect model
- Noncompensatory
- Take the aspect that is most close to you, you eliminate the choices that do not have your preferred aspect

Unitary vs. composite
- Unitary are items that are evaluated as a whole
- Composite are evaluated by aspects

Concept we should have a reading on
- Well defined problems: You know what the alternatives are; You know what the attributes are; Roughly estimate probabilities and utility
- Ill defined: We don’t know a lot about it 

Schema theory
- Use a schema (i.e. liberal) and use that to fill in the blanks
- 2 sets of questions: How likely are they to be wrong? How much do they give you advantages?},

Violations of this theory are traced to the rules that govern the framing of decision and to the psychophysical principles of evaluation embodied in prospect theory. Invariance and dominance are obeyed when their application is transparent and often violated in other situations. Because these rules are normatively essential but descriptively invalid, no theory of choice can be both normatively adequate and descriptively accurate."

More recently, this concept has been applied to the political arena with the suggestion that simply having a voice in the proceedings may not be enough. Similarly, the attitudes of external efficacy and political trust have long been linked. Integrating these two lines of research to incorporate important lessons about the dimensionality of external efficacy, I argue that giving people a voice in politics is not a universal remedy for ailing democracy. A voice that is perceived to have no influence can be more detrimental than not perceiving a voice at all. Moving out of the experimental setting by using survey data collected in a 2001 study of attitudes toward municipal government, I examine the impact that perceptions of voice and influence have on feelings of policy satisfaction and political trust. Findings suggest that perceptions of voice and influence do indeed have an impact on feelings of political trust and policy satisfaction. Neither political trust nor policy satisfaction responds positively to perceptions of increased voice alone. Believing that citizen voice, loud or quiet, has an influence is important. Feelings of policy satisfaction and political trust are increased only when respondents believe citizens had both increased voice and influence.},

  volume    = {96},
  comment   = {overview:
- subtle racial cues in campaign communications prime racial attitudes as predictors of candidate preference by making them more accessible in memory (rather than by increasing group importance)
- counter-stereotypic cues regarding blacks reduce racial priming (but effect for whites is inconsistent, increases racial priming...)
=> not simply presence of black images triggers racial priming but rather the meaning drawn from visual/narrative pairing in an advertisement

questions raised by paper:
- do racial cues prime racial attitudes? yes
- which types of cues are most effective? negative attributions about blacks without comparison to whites, more salient primes are stronger
- which mechanism? accessibility in memory rather than importance of group considerations

study/analyses/results:
- experimental analysis manipulating content of political ads in lab (non-black student sample)
- racially coded appeals boost explanatory power of racial attitudes
- racial appeals do not affect broader values such as individualism, PID, egalitarianism
- lexical decision task: racial appeals increase accessibility of racial concepts
- attitude-inconsistent racial appeals have no effect -> it's not only about the presence of the prime
- violating white stereotypes is different from violating black stereotypes (white inconsistent stereotypes boost influence of racial attitudes)
-> "counter-stereotypical cues do not make racial attitudes more accessible but, instead, may induce conscious processing of the racial content of the message, thereby increasing the self-reported importance of groups"

questions/comments:
- if the mechanism is cognitive accessibility of racial attitudes, why do they not work anymore when becoming explicit?

  comment   = {- effect of specific emotions on political participation: anger, anxiety, enthusiasm
- theoretical argument based on cognitive appraisal theory and affective intelligence model

cognitive appraisal theory: individuals take deliberate actions to cope with their emotions
- e.g. anger and anxiety differ with regard to the appraisal of attribution and control (c.f. p.159)
- anger triggers risk seeking behavior and problem-focused coping
- anxiety leads to risk avoidance and emotion focused coping
=> anxiety is expected to have mixed effects on participation

studies:
- experiment, national survey 2008, and pooled ANES 1980 - 2004

result:
-> anger, more than anxiety and enthusiasm, mobilizes

Overview:
Examines the effect of different emotional states (anger, anxiety, and enthusiasm) on mobilization. The theoretical discussion invokes both AIT and cognitive appraisal theory. Enthusiasm is hypothesized to evoke approach response and activate the disposition system, resulting in mobilization. Anger is also expected to generate approach response and mobilize voters. However, AIT and cognitive appraisal theories make divergent predictions for anxiety. AIT predicts anxiety to trigger the surveillance system, which might promote mobilization, while cognitive appraisal predicts avoidance response to anxiety, which would be demobilizing. Valentino et al. ultimately hypothesize that the effect of anxiety will be weak, mobilizing only the least costly forms of participation (e.g. talking to others about politics).

Method:
Study 1 uses and emotional induction task (i.e. having subjects write about something in the campaign that caused them to feel a certain emotion) to manipulate anxiety, anger, and enthusiasm. Study 2 is a national panel survey in which the emotions are measured rather than manipulated. Study 3 examines ANES data between 1980 and 2004, in which emotions are again measured. Various forms of participation are explored as outcome variables in the three studies, such as wearing a campaign button, volunteering for a campaign, attending a rally, talking to others, or donating money.

Findings:
Anger consistently boosted participation in all three studies. This effect is especially high among voters with access to resources enabling them to participate at high levels. The effect of enthusiasm is inconsistent across the three studies, only appearing to be substantial in study 3. Anxiety is also inconsistent, having no effect on participation in study 1, decreasing participation in study 2, and increasing less costly forms of participation in study 3. The key normative point is that negativity and emotionality in politics should not necessarily be condemned, as they may have a vital mobilizing effect.},

  comment   = {overview:
- two studies examining the "mediating role of emotions in the process of becoming a politically informed citizen"
- expectations: anger and anxiety have different effects on information search, anxiety serves as a mediator of the causal effect of political threats on information seeking and learning -> anxiety is expected to improve quality and quantity of information seeking
-  "we focus on the distinct impact of negative emotions--fear versus anger--on interest, information seeking, and learning about politics. We suspect fear can in fact stimulate political interest, enhance the quality of information seeking in the political arena, and boost learning while other negative emotions such as anger, and even positive ones like enthusiasm, tend not to" (249).

study 1:
- convenience sample, subjects are asked to recall and focus on events people, or occurences in the campaign that caused them to experience a given emotion
- after completing the emotion task, participants were asked to visit the websites of the presidential candiates to learn about the campaign
-> observe the impact of the emotional manipulation on the nature and extent of information seeking (+ self-reported attention to the campaign)

study 2:
- realistic political threat as a stimulus (positive/negative polling results for John Kerry in key swing states), then ask participants to visit newspaper's website
- examine self-reported emotions depending on threat condition
- examine how these self-reported emotions mediate the effect of the threat condition on information seeking

results:
- anger decreases information seeking -> might distract people during complex cognitive task
- anxiety can boost information seeking in some contexts, but in others, it might lead to more focused attention on subset of information and therefore suppress overall information seeking
- study 1: "while anger, enthusiasm, and anxiety can lead people to claim they will pay attention to the campaign, anger actually depresses total information seeking"
- study 2: "exposure [to realistic political threats] triggers several emotions but that only anxiety boosts information seeking and learning."
=> "anxiety can boost learning, while anger may lead people away from the kind of deliberation many democratic theorists cherish" (267)

questions/comments:
- results are not as decisive regarding the role of discrete emotions
-> study 1 anxiety and enthusiasm have negative (but insignificant) effect on information seeking
-> study 2 does not manipulate emotions independently and the mediation analysis (Baron/Kenny) is not convincing
-> garden of forking paths, would like to see a pre-registered replication},

- univariate ACE models do not tell us anything about causal direction -> black box, processes are not specified

summary:
- They show that much of the effect of personality on ideology is genetic. They then make the bogus argument that because both personality and ideology are developing at the same time that this means personality can’t be causing ideology. Some third cause is causing both. They have no proof of this at all, just conjecture. Can’t deal with the study from showing behavior as very young children predicts political attitudes (},

The authors argue that too much attention has been paid to finding statistically significant relationships, while too little attention has been paid to finding variables that improve our ability to predict civil wars. The result can be a distorted view of what matters most to the onset of conflict. Although these models may not be intended to be predictive models, prescriptions based on these models are generally based on statistical significance, and the predictive attributes of the underlying models are generally ignored. These predictions should not be ignored, but rather need to be heuristically evaluated because they may shed light on the veracity of the models. In this study, the authors conduct a side-by-side comparison of the statistical significance and predictive power of the different variables used in two of the most influential models of civil war. The results provide a clear demonstration of how potentially misleading the traditional focus on statistical significance can be. Until out-of-sample heuristics - especially including predictions - are part of the normal evaluative tools in conflict research, we are unlikely to make sufficient theoretical progress beyond broad statements that point to GDP per capita and population as the major causal factors accounting for civil war onset.},

- racial diversity (zip-code level) strengthens the connection b/w racial stereotypes and race-related policy attitudes among whites
- this effect is moderated by self-monitoring tendency: individuals who are not affected by egalitarian norms are more likely to show a negative effect of racial diversity
- effect is most pronounced if stereotypes fit to the respective racial policies

theoretical argument
- racial diversity in the environment makes race more salient
- but: living in environment with high diversity also makes it more likely to be exposed to egalitarian social norms
- self-monitoring tendency affects sensitivity to these social norms
-> white americans who are indifferent to social norms and who live in diverse neighborhoods are more likely to show effects of racial prejudice on race-related policy attitudes
- additional moderator: degree to which racial stereotype "fits" to the respective policy

data:
- New York State Racial Attitudes Survey combined with census data for context effects
- results confirm the hypotheses

question/comments:
- what about potential positive effects of exposure to diversity?
- what about diversity at work place etc.?

The central topic - racial stereotypes have greater influence on whites’ political attitudes in diverse racial contexts. They use New York State Racial Attitudes Survey (NYRAS) and measure racial stereotypes, political predispositions, political attitudes and racial context and self-monitoring.

Diverse geographic context: 1) increases the salience of race and potentially heightens the effect of stereotypes on race-related policy, 2) evokes tolerant racial norms that may inhibit the expression of racial negativity. Prior research suggests that low (vs. high) self-monitors [the concept of self-monitoring was developed to capture individual differences in sensitivity to situational norms and is used to assess the extent to which people are motivated to adjust their attitudes and behavior to fit such norms (Snyder 1974, 1979; Snyder and Gangestad 1986)] may be more immune to the pressures of racially tolerant norms in diverse geographic areas. 

Results indicate that the political effects of negative racial stereotypes are strong in diverse zip codes for whites who are least responsive to tolerant social norms (i.e., low self-monitors). Otherwise, when contextual diversity is low or among individuals who are comparatively more responsive to social norms (i.e., high self-monitors), racial stereotypes appear to have little political impact. 
Social desirability influences the expression of stereotypes among high self-monitors and that this explains (at least in part) why the connections between racial stereotypes and policy preferences are weak among these individuals. High self- monitors tend to tailor their stereotype responses in diverse local contexts by taking the middle value of the scale and by rejecting the stereotype. Researchers argue that this obscures the heightened racialization of whites’ racial policy attitudes in diverse residential contexts, a trend readily apparent among those less sensitive to social desirability and normative pressures. 

Broader implications – 1) geographic variation in racial diversity may condition the effectiveness of race-coded political advertising; 2) nature of political conflict over race-related policies is likely to depend on geographic considerations.},

First, it fails to take proper account of the lower falsifiability of the directional model. Second, it rests on empirical analyses that do not test the two theories on the predictions they actually make. Both are theories of individual choice, which implies intrapersonal comparisons of utility. Prior tests, however, have predominantly taken the form of interpersonal comparisons. A reanalysis based on the proper type of comparison yields an outcome diametrically opposed to that previously obtained. It also reveals an eccentricity effect that largely accounts for the apparent success of the directional model.},

  comment   = {overview:
- “Just as automatic behaviors can be disrupted when people analyze and decompose them, so can preferences and decisions be disrupted when people reflect about the reasons for their feelings” preference is automatic & holistic. Decomposing attitude & explaining it is conscious & piecemeal; the process the breaks the automatic preference not making it “correct” anymore.
- “People often do not have a well articulated, accessible attitude and thus do not start out with the bias to find only those reasons that are consistent with an initial reaction.” when not highly accessible attitude then no easy bias present to construct reasons (like motivated reasoning in strong priors), use top of head thoughts to justify attitude which may differ from real basis of attitude.
- Theory: “We suggest that reflecting about reasons will change people's attitudes when their initial attitude is relatively inaccessible and the reasons that are salient and plausible happen to have a different valence than people's initial attitude.”
- “Analyzing reasons highlights the cognitive component of attitudes and that these cognitively based attitudes will determine behaviors that are more cognitively based than affectively based. Given that the decision of whether to take a college course has a large cognitive component the attitude change that results from analyzing reasons might cause long-term changes in behavior.” Cognitive/affective processing match with cognitive/affective attitude/behavior.
- Take-away: What is a “good” decision? Very subjective and contextual. Evaluation is normatively better if you don’t think about reasons/considerations. Contrast to normative value of thinking.
- Evolve both OL and memory based models so we can be responsive to both immediate context & long-term standing decision – need hybrid! Balance two processes: 1) long term default = OL tally, and 2) short term context = memory based reasoning

  comment   = {Previous Research & Hypotheses:
- Wilson and Schooler (1991) found evidence that when individuals deliberate over their attitudes (why they possess those attitudes), they are more likely to focus their attention on “non-optimal” criteria. In the current article, Wilson and colleagues follow-up on these findings by exploring the cognitive mechanism(s) through which such processes occur.
- They hypothesize that deliberation (introspection) about the reasons why an attitude is formed causes people to focus their attention on thoughts that are accessible in memory, and increases the extent to which these people view such accessible thoughts as being applicable to their current attitudes.
- They propose that this can occur in at least three ways:
 - When a thought comes to mind as part of a deliberation (search for reasons), people may be less aware of its biased source than when people are simply asked to recall information (Greenwald 1968 study asking subjects to recall specifically “pro” or “con” arguments)
 - The act of deliberation may cause people to look past their recalled information, and instead generalize from specific memories to more general qualities of the attitude object
 - Deliberation might trigger memories that are consistent with accessible information
- In addition, they posit that two conditions must be met in order for there to be attitude change stemming from introspection:
 - Accessible thoughts must be at least somewhat inconsistent with prior attitudes toward an object
 -People must assume that these thoughts are applicable to their current attitude (reflect how they feel)

Experimental Design: 
- Subjects were given 14 pieces of information about an unknown target object (positive, negative, and neutral). In a memory boosting task, they were provided with either the positive or negative pieces of information. Subjects were then asked to fill out a randomly assigned Reason or Recall questionnaire. The main DV of interest in the experiment was a 4-item scale of “liking” toward the target object (α = .75).
- In a second study, evaluations of the target object were changed to “how good of a social worker would this person make?” and the key manipulation was whether or not subjects formed their impressions via on-line processing or memory-based. 

Key Findings:
- The effects of analyzing reasons depend on the accessibility of what people recall about a stimulus. When people analyzed reasons, they used accessible thoughts to explain why they felt the way they did and based their attitudes on these thoughts. While the memory manipulation was successful in facilitating recall of positive/negative thoughts, there was no significant effect of the manipulation on attitudes toward the target person in the Recall condition. These subjects did not base their attitudes on these thoughts. Instead, their initial impressions played a greater role (which was confirmed in a follow-up study that measured initial impressions toward an object).
- In a second experiment, the researchers manipulated whether subjects formed their impressions through on-line vs. memory-based processing. The results showed that analyzing reasons increased the extent to which subjects based their evaluations on accessible thoughts (only positive traits were used in the memory-boosting task), independent of whether people’s initial attitudes were formed via on-line or memory-based processing.

Implications:
- The findings in this series of studies touches on the argument that there is a distinction between affective and cognitive components of attitudes, and that introspection increases the accessibility of cognition at the expense of affect (Millar and Tesser, 1986). While Wilson and colleagues do not disagree with this, their findings show that this is not the only way which introspection can result in attitude change. They make the argument that introspection will change attitudes when such introspection produces thoughts of a contrasting valence than people’s initial attitudes, regardless of their cognitive/affective nature.
- These findings (and subsequent research questions) are important because attitude change can be consequential. If people are making choices based on this accessibility-driven introspection, such choices can be problematic when they stand in opposition to one’s initial impressions and/or considerations. In addition, such processes can be especially problematic when resulting in “non-optimal” choices (Wilson & Schooler, 1991).

Take-away:
- There are circumstances in which memory-based recall can trump the on-line evaluation. But requires the time and mental effort to go through the cognitive process. Both OL and memory processes can occur – hybrid relationship that they inform evaluation. Show differences b/t responses in a deliberative democracy situation & those in voting booth or survey response.

Criticism:
- this process might not be realistically what is happening in the voting booth or survey response.},

I conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate whether voters focus on the problem of electoral selection or if they instead focus on electoral sanctioning. If voters are forward-looking but uncertain about politiciansï¿½ unobservable characteristics, then it is rational to focus on selection. But doing so undermines democratic accountability because selection renders sanctioning an empty threat. In contrast to rational choice predictions, the experimental results indicate a strong behavioral tendency to use a retrospective voting rule. Additional experiments support the interpretation that retrospective voting is a simple heuristic that voters use to cope with a cognitively difficult inference and decision problem and, in addition, suggest that voters have a preference for accountability. The results pose a challenge for theories of electoral selection and voter learning and suggest new interpretations of empirical studies of economic and retrospective voting.},

- Two thought systems for thinking and feeling? “This review suggests that a separation b/t affect and cognition may well have a psychological and a biological basis. In contrast to cold cognitions, affective responses are effortless, inescapable, irrevocable, holistic, more difficult to verbalize, yet easier to communicate and to understand.”

CHAPTER 2

role of elite discourse:
- stereotypes/frames of reference to simplify politics, reliance on elite cues
- elite discourse shapes public opinion -> unified vs. polarized elite cues cause similar opinion distributions among public
-> show how variations in elite discourse affects direction and organization of mass opinion
- measure elite opinion as monolithic or disagreement

political awareness among public
- high variance around low mean
-> elections in low information environment
- political awareness increases exposure but also increases capacity to react critically to certain information
- individuals with high political knowledge are useually less likely to change their opinions in campaigns etc.
- moderately aware are most susceptible to influence -> nonlinear effects
- measure: knowledge of neutral/factual information

political predispositions:
- stable individual-level traits that regulate acceptance of political communications
- political values as most important predisposition -> but requires some minimum information
-> how do individuals use information from pol environment to translate their values and other predispositions into opinions
- ideology as organization of value dimensions and other concerns

problems with mass opinion reports:
- over-time instability
- response effects
- question-wording effects
-> question-answering model, no true attitudes but rather constructed opinion in response to particular stimuli

CHAPTER 3

main question: how do citizens learn about politics and convert information into opinions
- persuasive message cueing message -> considerations

RAS-model:
- reception axiom: cognitive engagement (political awareness) -> receive political messages
- resistance axiom: people resist arguments that are inconsistent with predisposition (if they have necessary contextual info)
- accessibility axiom: recent considerations are more likely to be retrieved from memory
- response axiom: answers to survey questions constructed by average of salient and accessible considerations
-> opinion statements "are the outcome of a process in which people receive new information, decide whether to accept it, and then sample at the moment of answering questions"

GENERAL SUMMARY:
Zaller’s work is in direct response to Converse’s belief that people don’t know what their attitudes are and are basically making them up when asked to give a self-report. Zaller thinks that instead of people being absent of opinion, people are really filled with lots of differing and contrasting opinions and whichever ones are made salient are those most likely to be expressed (which can make it look like people have unstable attitudes). The first half of this book is dedicated to the nature and structure of opinions, while the second half is devoted to exploring how those opinions can change (persuasion techniques). Zaller concludes that attitudes are not directly retrieved from memory, but rather are constructed through priming, salience, the environment, etc. The RAS (Receive Accept Sample) model of forming/displaying attitudes has four axioms: Reception (predispositions towards an issue), Resistance (political sophistication/awareness), Accessibility (salience), Response (average of salient considerations). Also note that the more aware (i.e., sophisticated) you are regarding an issue the more consistency you will show in your expressed attitudes about that issue.},

- monte carlo studies that look at different effect sizes (3, 5, 10\%) -> simulational scenarios
- most surveys do not have enough power to detect modest / realistic effect sizes

goals:
1) suggest what a serious justification for the proper size of a national election study might look like
2) show how to determine what can and cannot be reliably accomplished with existing data sets

data characteristics that affect statistical power in models of campaign effects:
- variance of true-score media exposure and reliability of this scale
- residual variance in standard voting models (measured by r-square
- degree of multicollinearity b/w IV and DVs

results:
- detection of exposure effects is likely to be unreliable unless the effects are both large and captured in a large survey

Conclusion: what should be done?
- bigger studies
- scholars who consume surveys should make use of power analysis

study:
- closed attitude items + open question about the issues raised
- survey manipulation: asked about considerations before or after closed item is answered -> retrospective probe vs. prospective/stop and think probe
- analyzed ambivalence in considerations, correlation b/w considerations and attitudes etc.

questions/comments:
- rationalization in retrospective probe?
- mention opposing remarks in order to appear unbiased?
- knowing an counterargument does not imply that the consideration affects opinion..
- desire to appear consistent could cause correlation -> opinion formation is still a black box

Summary:
There is opinion instability over time and context sensitivity in opinion surveys. This is not because individuals lack meaningful attitudes (Converse 1964) or on account of measurement error (eg., Achen 1975, 1983), but this is because individuals hold competing considerations on most issues (ie, they are intrinsically ambivalent). They do not carry with them ready-made (‘true’) attitudes on every topic, but the concrete response that is given at any point in time is created in this moment from the considerations that are accessible, by averaging out over the competing considerations. Depending of what exactly is accessible in a particular moment (on top of one’s head), this can result in instability over time and context sensitivity. Accessible considerations are those that have recently been thought about. Consequence for sophisticates: they have multiple considerations salient in memory, many considerations to be averaged across, more stable than when only a few are available.

Method: ANES panel data. They ask respondents to indicate which considerations (pro and con) come to their minds on certain topics and they ask for their overall opinion on those topics. They deduce 18 hypotheses from their model and test them. They find, e.g.: people who are more interested/involved in politics have thought more about political issues and thus have more considerations accessible; because individuals average across considerations, there is strong correlation between closed-ended answers and general direction of considerations; politically involved individuals exhibit more over time stability, because they sample from a large pool of considerations and thus the single samples are more similar to each other than when sampling from a small pool of considerations for low involved individuals; people are more stable on doorstep issues because routinely thing about them and hence accessible; more ambivalent respondents are more instable across time.},

- can political thinking sufficiently described by unidimensional lib/con conceptualization or is it multidimensional?
- are there neurocognitive patterns that support a multidimensional conceptualiation?

method: two studies
1) multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on reported similarity b/w policy statements
2) fMRI captures activation patterns depending on dimensions of the stimuli (same policy statements

results:
- MDS: 3 dimensions can explain variability in political beliefs: individualism, conservatism, radicalism
- fMRI: 3 dimensions activate different brain areas
=> "In summary, we showed that the representation of complex political beliefs relies on three fundamental dimensions, each reflected in distinctive patterns of neural activation"

questions / comments:
- overall very interesting paper/approach!
- is extremity in the statements really a useful 3rd dimension to understand political reasoning?
- how do these dimensions relate to other arguments for multidimensional conceptualization of ideology? -> author argues it's consistent with B5 studies etc., but what about social/economic dimension?
- maybe categorization based on similarity and specific evaluation yield different dimensions due to different nature of the task?
- "fMRI was then used to identify the brain regions whose neural activity is modulated by the salience of the identified criteria/dimensions when people ï¿½ï¿½think politicallyï¿½ï¿½, independently from their agreement with, or preferences for, a specific political statement."
-> activation patterns due to stimuli vs. differential activation patterns for liberals and conservatives?},

However, empirical evidence indicates that its impact may be detrimental. To investigate this phenomenon further, this article examines the specific nature of the relationships among social involvement, social trust, and four different types of norms of citizenship. Social capital acts on these norms in two different ways. First, it varies with the specific norms of citizenship. Second, the different components of social capital do not necessarily exert similar effects. In this article, the negative and significant relationships between social trust and norms of social order are revealed, indicating the ``dark sides{''} of social capital. This finding challenges the common wisdom about the positive interrelationship between social capital and a citizenry's public spiritedness in a democratic state.},

The present work, however, reports robust and statistically significant correlations between generalized social trust, on the one hand, and confidence in political institutions and satisfaction with democracy, on the other. The associations are significant in 23 European countries and in the United States. This article argues that its findings are more accurate and more reliable than much of the previous work because they are based on better and more sensitive measures.

CHAPTER 1: Judgment under Uncertainty 
- heuristics in the context of subjective assessments of probabilities --> biases 

1) Representativeness 
- Insensitivity to prior probability of outcomes: prior prob is ignored if additional info is given 
- Insensitivity to sample size: e.g. when the likelihood of the deviation of a sample statistic is evaluated 
- Misconceptions of chance: "looks random", corrective process 
- Insensitivity to predictability: only judge favorableness of information, not reliability or accuracy for prediction 
- The illusion of validity: internal concistency is major determinant of confidence in predictions 
- Misconceptions of regression: people disregard regression towards the mean 

2) Availability 
- Biases due to the retrievnbility of instances 
- Biases due to the effectiveness of a search set 
- Biases of imaginability: evaluate prob by ease to construct instances

- illusory correlation 

2) Adjustment and Anchoring 
- Insufficient adjustment 
- Biases in the evaluation of conjunctive and disjunctive events: overestimate the probability of conjunctive events 
- Anchoring in the assessment of subjective probability distributions

CHAPTER 7 - 14:

Causality and Attribution:
• Attribution tasks: (1) causal judgment (what are the causes?), (2) social inference (attributes of actors and situation), and (3) prediction and estimation of outcomes
• Characteristics of information: distinctiveness (same behavior in other situations?), consistency (same behavior at all times?), consensus (same behavior of most actors?)
• Potential Biases:
 – Disregarding consensus information and base rate neglect (c.f. also causal vs. incidental base rates)
 – Focus on concrete information (vs. abstract information)
 – Role of causal schemas in estimating probabilities: greater impact of causal than diagnostic data of equal informativeness, easier predictions
 – Reluctance to revise causal model, impressions, beliefs, and broader social theories in light of contradicting facts
• Explanations/Mechanisms:
 – non-motivational: fundamental attribution error, role-conferred advantages in self-presentation, salience or availability biases, false consensus or egocentric attribution bias
 – motivational: self-serving bias
 – biased search, recollection, and assimilation of information; formation of causal explanation (for belief perseverance)

Availability:
• Estimation of probabilities by assessing availability or associative distance: ease with which instances or associations could be brought to mind
• Example: If self-generated inputs are more available, individuals would be more likely to claim more responsibility for a joint product than other participants would attribute to them
• Explanations/Mechanisms: selective encoding and storage of information, diﬀerential retrieval, informational disparities, motivational inﬂuences
• Simulational heuristic: availability for construction as a diﬀerent mechanism than availability for retrieval},

- ALLBUS 2008 data including open-ended responses about the meaning of left and right (OE access is restricted)
- topic model of open-ended response where individuals describe their associations with left and right (stm)
- respondents have different associations with the concepts of left and right (H1)
- associations are related to self-placement on left-right scale (H2)
- associations are related to education and socio-cultural background (H3)

conclusion:
- comparability of left-right scale across individuals is impaired
- BUT: I buy the general argument, but I am not sure if they can show what they claim given their data. The results are also consistent with an alternative explanation where people on the left/right name different associations for both sides because of their own self-placement (i.e. reversed causal order)

comments:
- good starting point for citations regarding OE questions in political psychology research!
- combine argument with King's vignette methodology to validate scale, several points for future research in conclusion

- knowledge gap is a measurement artifact, e.g. due to guessing, types of questions (no "gender"-issues)
- gender gap exists, but information reduces it -> perspective of the authors

studies:
1) 2 convenience samples (MTurk + Students): present information in seemingly unrelated question, subsequent knowledge question -> compare treatment (no info) with control

- analysis of reddit community "Change My View": original poster (OP) state a specific opinion and asks challengers to change their view (which they signal by awarding a delta)
- examines effects of discussion dynamics and language features on persuasion as well as stylistic features of open-mindedness

main findings:
- early challengers are more successful
- non-monotonic relationship of back-and-forth on persuasion (very short and very long >5 interactions are less likely to be successful)
- number of unique challengers increases likelihood of success (but not when talking about the same counterargument)
- among similar pairs, persuasive arguments use more different wording
- lower arousal, less positive sentiment is more successful. Results for concreteness and dominance are unclear
- personal pronouns, dominance, number of paragraphs (formatting) increases open-mindedness
- political topics appear to be less malleable
=> interaction patterns as well as language is found to distinguish persuasive arguments

questions/comments:
- lots of useful citations as well as insights for analysis strategy of discussion logs
- does not focus on topics or political arguments, no causal claims},

- racial gap in political knowledge can be attributed to differential item functioning induced by cultural differences and perceptual biases among blacks and Latinos (rather than resource-related factors)
- perceptual bias leads to different interpretation of political knowledge questions
- example: Latinos interpret liberal as position on the right rather than left political spectrum
- uses assessment of ideological and policy positions to measure knowledge (problematic?) and corrects for DIF using Blackbox Transpose procedure (generalization of the Aldrich-McKelvey scaling developed by Poole)
- racial gap disappears once DIF is accounted for

comments:
- convincing theoretical argument, but the empirics are somewhat unclear
- policy placements are not straightforward as measures of knowledge
- author only looks at average placement and not the spread
- DIF corrects for systematic deviations among the groups, but to what extent can these deviations be attributed to different interpretations rather than lack of knowledge? It would be more convincing if the analysis additionally took into account the uncertainty around policy placements.},

  comment   = {overview:
- gender-relevant political knowledge items close the gender gap (e.g. levels of women's representation in federal government)
- gender-relevant knowledge behaves similarly to conventional knowledge as a predictor of participation, interest, and efficacy 
-> knowledge gap exists because women and men know different things (and respond to questions differently)
-> "knowledge levels are, in part, a reflection of the items we employ" -> need broader definition...

analyses:
1) descriptive results for knowledge questions -> women perform better on some gender-relevant items, but worse on conventional items
2) determinants of knowledge -> gender gap disappears, other determinants are similar
3) knowledge as an independent variable -> similar effects on participation, interest, and efficacy

questions:
- some choices in the analysis seem questionable, e.g. very high lower bound to classify %women in Congress as correct respons -> men tend to underestimate the percentage!
- political interest is used as an independent variable in the first step, and then as a dependent variable in the second step of the analyses...?

comment:
- some interesting cites
- check analyses for sophistication paper},

  volume     = {31},
  comment    = {overview:
- research on democratic representation / responsiveness usually assumes stable and exogeneous preferences which stands in contrast to much of the public opinion research
-> defining "quality opnion" is often flawed/problematic and we should therefore focus on the process of opinion formation rather than the actual substance

Criteria of "quality" public opinion and how they are problematic:
1) Information and Opinions: people often lack knowledge, it is unclear how certain knowledge is actually necessary to increase competence (c.f. Lupia's argument) + cues/heuristics can help
2) Attitude Constraint and Opinions: affected by elites, often overlaps with motivated reasoning and dogmatism/intolerance instead of quality opinions
3) Values and Opinions: Unclear whether values are really endogeneous, they can also be affected by elite rhetoric
4) Frames and Opinion Stability: frames influence public opinion, preferences are not stable
5) Political Parties and Opinons: consistency with preferred party is not a good standard for quality opinion, question of motivated reasoning, nature of party identity unclear
=> Criterion of stable/exogeneous preferences is questionable and "opinions meeting the criterion are not necessarily any more deseving of representational responsiveness" (p. 477)

Conclusion:
- "Assessment of what constitutes a 'quality opinion' in terms of its substance is a false start, as consensus will not be attainable." Instead, we need...
1) realistic criteria for quality opinion that avoid a mismatch w/ normative theory
2) explicit counterfactuals: what does it mean to meet the standard, and vice versa
3) less focus on the content/substance of opinions and more on the process and motivation that underlies the formation of opinions
=> one example: motivation to be accurate by asking people to justify their opinions -> generate higher quality opinions},

- types of journal articles: research report, review article, theoretical article -> focuses on research reports
- note that political science articles don't always follow this explicit structure

structure of research report:
- title and abstract: main idea + brief synopsis of the study, compare to movie review -> not sufficient to fully understand the research
- introduction: presents problem, previous research, specific contribution -> what problem is studied, how does it go beyond past investigations?
- method: describe how the questions/hypotheses are tested, measurement, experimental design etc.
- results: statistical analyses, test hypotheses, interpretation of tests -> what are the findings? hypotheses supported?
- discussion: summary of the findings, relating back to the literature -> what conclusions can be drawn? was the question answered? further research?
-> sometimes it makes sense to look at the discussion/conclusion first to help guide reading the main parts

how critical should we be?
- difficult without prior statistical knowledge
- replication is very important!},

- Study 2: contemporary environmental discourse is is largely based on moral concerns related to harm/care
- Study 3: proenvironmental rhetoric framed in purity dimension eliminates the difference b/w liberals and conservatives in environmental attitutedes

Study 1:
a) Craigslist sample: liberals evaluate a person who doesn't recycle as less moral (conservatives do not)
b) students: liberals use moral reasons and perceptions of right and wrong when explaining their answer to a question of how important it is to be environmentally friendly

Study2:
a) youtube videos on environment mention dimension of harm/care most (human coder)
b) newspaper articles on environment mention dimension fo harm/care most (human coder)

Study 3:
- Student sample with different moral frames for environmental message, attitude difference b/w liberals and conservatives disappears in the purity condition
- there is some evidence that the effect of purity rhetoric on conservatives is moderated by heightened disgust (although this could almost be seen as an alternative explanation)

- studies are not particularly convincing, garden of forking paths etc.

  abstract  = {Enns et al. respond to recent work by Grant and Lebo and Lebo and Grant that raises a number of concerns with political scientists’ use of the general error correction model (GECM). While agreeing with the particular rules one should apply when using unit root data in the GECM, Enns et al. still advocate procedures that will lead researchers astray. Most especially, they fail to recognize the difficulty in interpreting the GECM’s “error correction coefficient.” Without being certain of the univariate properties of one’s data it is extremely difficult (or perhaps impossible) to know whether or not cointegration exists and error correction is occurring. We demonstrate the crucial differences for the GECM between having evidence of a unit root (from Dickey–Fuller tests) versus actually having a unit root. Looking at simulations and two applied examples we show how overblown findings of error correction await the uncareful researcher.},

- examine opinionation (number of opinions toward government policies) using survey data from NES
- main determinants: objective political competence (knowledge, media exposure, political interest, behavioral participation only weakly), cognitive sophistication, and external efficacy (internal efficacy was only weakly related)
- the authors still find a gender gap in opinionation, although there is an interesting age interaction: old men are more opinionaten that old women, and young women are more opinionated than young men. However, the authors argue that this is more likely to be a life cycle effect rather than a socialization/generational effect
- opinionation is related to more direct measures of political expertise, but the relationship is not so strong to suggest that they reflect the same underlying construct: "Therefore, we believe that the frequency of expressing political attitudes in a survey should be treated as a measure of opinionation and not as a measure of objective political competence, political so- phistication, or political expertise."

  comment   = {overview:
- review of Taber/Lodge (2006) motivated reasoning study
- the original study might overstate the effect of motivated reasoning in politics
- focusing on individual accuracy motivation is a good way of assessing citizen competence -> includes taking into account different perspectives when forming opinon

reasons why T/L study might overstate motivated reasoning
1) instructions not sufficient to induce accuracy motivation (e.g. consider alternative considerations etc.)
2) student sample has liberal bias, which might imply that participants thought they would discuss the issue with like-minded individuals
3) study focuses on highly contested issues with strong priors
4) prior opinion and follow-up opinion are measured in the same session, which can induce consistency

=> "In sum, motivated reasoning may occur with much less frequency when participants are induced to consider alternative perspectives or to reflect on their reasoning process; when there is greater accountability to people who disagree; when less contentious issues are in play; and/or when opinions are explored over a longer period of time." (204) -> motivation to form accurate opinions

context factors that induce accurate motivation (see p. 206):
- individuals anticipate having to elaborate on the rationale for their opinions
- social expectations
- competetive or conflictual information environments
- anxiety

=> Accuracy as a Normative Ideal: (also reduces framing effects btw.)
"Efforts to enhance 'voter competence' would be better off focusing on inducing the accuracy motivation rather than providing information alone. [...] [C]itizens should aim to process information consciously and to consider multiple perspectives." (209)},

- emphasis on factual knowledge for political competence is misplaced, since individuals process political information through their personal experiences
- Ethnographies/discussions in community dialogue program, regular citizens, and political journalists/public opinion scholars
- "We chose to examine political knowledge by looking at political conversation because it is a widespread29 manner in which we believe people gain factual political knowledge" (p. 756)
-> Personal experience plays a central role in interpreting facts learned through (e.g.) the media, important part of making sense of politics, facts are more credible if experienced

Information-Based Model of Civic Competence:
- conventional perspective, only focuses on facts 
-> lots of theoretical issues, posession of facts does not improve quality of political debate or correct misperceptions

Expanded Model of Civic Competence: 
- central aspect of civic competence is not factual information but being able to understand/recognize other's perspectives and experiences
-> "values the ability of citizens to interact with one another and share experiences as a necessary condition for collectively governing each other " (p. 758)

- good cites in the paper, some interesting theoretical arguments regarding the importance of factual knowledge in political competence},

- analysis of annotated reddit posts to explore the linguistic and behavioral features of dogmatism in social media

Substantive findings:
- dogmatic language occurs across a diverse set of topics
- individuals who are dogmatic on one topic are more likely to bye dogmatic on another topic -> suggests deeper personality trait
- a user's dogmatism tends to bring out dogmatism in conversation partner -> vicious circle in interactions

Comments:
- opinionation vs. dogmatism? personality as a confounder?

  comment   = {overview:
- preprocessing choices: (P)unctuation, (N)umbers, (L)owercasing, (S)temming, stop(W)ord removal, (3) n-gram inclusion, (I)nfrequently used terms
- substantive theory to justify preprocessing steps is typically too vague, and researchers often simply adopt previous conventions that were largely based on supervised methods
- best practices regarding preprocessing from supervised methods are not necessarily applicable for unsupervised methods
- preprocessing can change substantive conclusions of unsupervised learning methods in text analysis (scaling/wordfish + topic models)
- propose measure based on change in pairwise distance between documents to evaluate the sensitivity of inference for unsupervised models w/ large # of possible preprocessing steps
-> examine how unusual a DTM is relative to all other possibilities

practical advice:
1) use theory to choose potential preprocessing steps
2) generate preText score for random sample of up to 500-1000 documents
3) examine preText score regression results:
- All Parameter Estimates Are Not Signiﬁcantly Diﬀerent From Zero -> proceed with analysis
- Strong Theory, Some Parameter Estimates Are Signiﬁcantly Diﬀerent From Zero -> replicate analysis across all preprocessing steps that are significant
- Weak Theory, Some Parameter Estimates Are Signiﬁcantly Diﬀerent From Zero -> repeat analysis across all preprocessing steps and report average results

questions/comments:
- IMPORTANT for knowledge paper: examines consequences of preprocessing in topic models by checking whether key terms appear as top terms for some specifications (which is not always the case). The argument regarding top terms is very much related to my argument regarding distinctiveness.
- The baseline for preText scores/unusual preprocessing is the original document. But that is not necessarily always a useful baseline to consider!},

  abstract  = {Abstract Emotions feature prominently in political rhetoric and media frames, and they have potent effects on how people process information. Yet, existing research has largely overlooked the influence of disgust, which is a basic emotion that leads people to avoid contamination threats. We illustrate how disgust may impede learning, as compared to the more commonly studied emotion of anxiety. Disgust and anxiety are natural reactions to many kinds of political threats, but the two emotions influence political engagement in different ways. This study investigated the distinctive effects of disgust in a series of experiments that manipulated information about the outbreak of an infectious disease. People who felt disgusted by a health threat were less likely to learn crucial facts about the threat and less likely to seek additional information. Thus, disgust has the counterintuitive effect of decreasing public engagement in precisely those situations where it is most critical.},

  abstract  = {This study explores whether and how individuals evoke moral considerations when discussing their political beliefs. By analyzing open-ended responses in the 2012 American National Election Study using a previously validated dictionary, I find systematic ideological differences in moral reasoning, even when respondents are not explicitly asked about morality. The study proceeds to show that the reliance on moral considerations in attitude expression is amplified by the moral content of individual media environments.},

  comment   = {Overview:
- representative f2f survey in Spain (N = 2k) comparing 27/33? political knowledge items
- question type impacts gender gap:  content (classical topics, functioning of democratic institutions, specific policies, and economic issues), format (closed ended and open ended items), temporal dimension (current versus non current)
- size of the gender gap in knowledge is conditional upon the type of question being asked

Hypotheses:
1. The size of the gender gap in favor of men is greater for questions inquiring about the traditional arenas of electoral and partisan politics.
2. The gender gap will be smaller in questions that do not relate to current events.
3. The size of the gender gap is greater when the survey questions used to measure knowledge are in the closed-ended format.

Recommendations for knowledge questions:
- "The gender gap in favor of men substantively diminishes (or even reverses) in questions that are open ended, that do not rely on knowledge of recent facts, and that go beyond the traditional arenas of electoral	and partisan politics."
- "Although previously overlooked in the literature, this finding suggests an important explanation for the existence of the gender gap in knowledge: the lower propensity of women in comparison to men to be exposed to political news in the mass media."
- "Our work suggests that future research might attempt to follow innovative paths on the development of measures of political knowledge. This implies considering more issue-specific knowledge items than the traditional battery of electoral and partisan questions by including different substantive content, diverse question formats, and items that refer both to the past and to current political processes."

- D2 receptor gene has effect on social attachement as well as cognitive abilities -> hypothesis for effect on partisanship
- 2 designs: case-control design + family-based design (-> method not clear to me)
- both designs suggest that D2 gene increases the likelihood of partisanship. Hoever, there is no evidence for the effecct on the direction (dem vs rep)
- there is also a positive effect on voting, which is likely to be mediated through partisanship

  comment   = {overview:
- argues for integreation of social science into broader framework (along with physics, chemistry, biology, building a coherent causal chain) through evolution -> Integrated Causal Model (ICM)
- Standard Social Science Model (SSSM) is obsolete, does not allow for integration with other scientific disciplines -> see chapter for detailed discussion of flaws in SSSM
- discussion of content-free psychology focused on learning (SSSM) vs. modular or domain-specific cognitive psychologists (ICM)
- great discussion/refute of the (false) moral criticism of evolutionary approaches
- nature-nurture debate is fundamentally misguided, both are always intertwined and interact with each other
-> culture is the manufactured product of evolved psychological mechanisms situated in individuals living in groups
-> "learning" -- like "culture," "rationality," and "intelligence" -- is not an explanation for anything, but is rather a phenomenon that itself requires explanation 

basic argument:
1) The SSSM (along with its set of assumptions and inferences about humans, their minds, and their collective interaction) provided the conceptual foundation that served as a warrant for the isoloationism of the social sciences (i.e., lack of connection to other disciplines)
2) The SSSM suffers from a series of major defects that make it a profoundly misleading framework, which are the reason for the lack of scientific progress in the social sciences
3) The ICM is a better framework that directly connects the social sciences to other disciplines like evolutionary biology, cognitive sciences, etc.
4) Main insights of ICM (copy/paste):
a. the human mind consists of a set of evolved information-processingmechanisms instantiated in the human nervoussystem;
b. these mechanisms, and the developmental programs that produce them, are adaptations, produced by natural selection over evolutionary time in ancestral environments;
c. many of these mechanisms are functionally specialized to producebehavior that solves particular adaptive problems, such as mate selection, language acquisition, family relations, and cooperation;
d. to be functionally specialized, many of these mechanisms must be richly structured in a content-specificway;
e. content-specific information-processing mechanisms generate some of the particular content of human culture, including certain behaviors, artifacts, and linguistically transmitted representations;
f. the cultural content generated by these and other mechanisms is then present to be adopted or modified by psychological mechanisms situated in other members of the population;
g. this sets up epidemiological and historical population-level processes; and
h. these processes are located in particular ecological, economic, demographic, and intergroup social contexts or environments.

definition of adaptation:
(1) a system of inherited and reliably developing properties that recurs among members of a species that
(2) became incorporated into the species' standard design because during the period of their incorporation, 
(3) they were coordinated with a set of statistically recurrent structural properties outside the adaptation (either in the environment or in the other parts of the organism), 
(4) in such a waythat the causal interaction of the two (in the context of the rest of the properties of the organism) produced functional outcomes that were ultimately tributary to propagation with sufficient frequency (i.e., it solvedan adaptive problem for the organism)

central elements of evolutionary functional analysis:
1. An adaptive target: a description of what counts as a biologically successful outcome in a given situation. 
2. Background conditions: a description of the recurrent structure of the ancestral world that is relevant to the adaptive problem. 
3. A design: a description of the articulated organization of recurrent features in the organism that together comprise the adaptation or suspected adaptation. 
4. A performance examination:a description of what happens when the proposed adaptation mechanistically interacts with the world. 
5. A performance evaluation: a description or analysis of how well (or how poorly) the design, under circumstances paralleling ancestral conditions, managed to produce the adaptive target (the set of biologically successful outcomes). The better the mechanism performs, the more likely it is that one has identified an adaptation.
-> When they are linked together, the five components outlined above not only provide a framework for the explanation of facts that are already known; they also form a powerful heuristic system for the generation of new knowledge

adaptionist perspective:
- organisms are integrated collections of problem-solving mechanisms organized to propagate their designs
- selection and complex adaptation creates uniformity
- humans, and other complex, long-lived, outbreeding organisms must be very nearly uniform in thoose genes that underlie complex adaptations -> evolutionary perspective focuses on the common human psyche, rather than on group differences
-> universal encompassing functional superstructure + low level biochemicalvariation

Evolvability criterion for potential candidate designs for human psychological architecture:
1. Obviously, at a minimum, a candidate architecture must be able to perform all of the tasks and subtasks necessary for it to reproduce.
2. Given that human minds evolved out of prehuman primate minds, a hypothesis should not entail that an architecture that is substantially inferior at promoting its own propagation (its inclusive fitness) replace an architecture that was better designed to promote fitness under ancestral conditions. 
3. A candidate architecture should not require the world to be other than it really is.
4. In a related vein, a candidate theory should not invoke hypotheses that require assumptions about the coordinated actions of others (or any part of the environment) unless it explains how such coordination reliably came about during Pleistocene hunter-gatherer life. 
5. A candidate model must not propose the existence of complex capacities in the human psychological architecture unless these capacities solve or solved adaptive (design-propagative) problems for the individual.

Arguments in favor of domain-specific mechanisms (instead of domain-general mechanisms):
1. In order to perform tasks successfully more often than chance, the architecture must be able to discriminate successful performance from unsuccessful performance
2. As discussed at length, domain-general, content-independent mechanisms are inefficient, handicapped, or inert compared to systems that also include specialized techniques for solving particular families of adaptive problems. 
3. Many problems that humans routinely solve are simply not solvable by any known general problem-solving strategy, as demonstrated by formal solvability analyses on language acquisition 
4. Different adaptive problems are often incommensurate. They cannot, in principle, be solved by the same mechanism
5. Many adaptive courses of action can be neither deduced nor learned by general criteria alone because theydepend on statistical relationships that are unobservable to the relevant individual
6. As discussed, the more generally framed problems are, the more computational systems suffer from combinatorial explosion, in which proliferating alternatives choke decision and learning procedures, bringing the system to a halt.
7. Everythinga domain-general system can do can be done as well or better by a system that also permits domain-specific mechanisms because selection can incorporate any successful domain-general strategies into an architecture without displacing its existingrepertoire of domain-specific problem-solvers.
-> The solution to the paradox of how to create an architecture that is at the same time both powerful and more general is to bundle larger numbers of specialized mechanisms together so that in aggregate, rather than individually, they address a larger range of problems. Breadth is achieved not by abandoning domain-specific techniques but by adding more ofthem to the system.

Decomposing the Traditional Concept of Culture:
- Metaculture: Mechanisms functionally organized to use crosscultural regularities in the social and nonsocial environment give rise to panhuman mental contents and organization.
- Evoked culture: Alternative, functionally organized, domainspecific mechanisms are triggeredby local circumstances; leads to within-group similarities and between-group differences.
- Epidemiological culture: Observer's inferential mechanisms construct representations similar to those present in others; domain-specific mechanisms influence which representations spread through a population easily and which do not.
->  The point is simply that cultural and social phenomena can never be fully divorced from the structure of the human psychological architecture or understood without reference to its design.

  publisher = {OUP USA},
  title     = {Foundations of neuroeconomic analysis},
  year      = {2011},
  comment   = {overview:
- discusses integration of neuroscience, psychology, and economics in a common theoretical framework
- provides an intuitive overview of each discipline and discusses potential points of reduction similar to physics < chemistry < biology, as well as their benefits
- general point: in order to integrate neuroscience, psychology, and economics, one has to fully understand the premises (and philosophical traditions) of each discipline
- main argument: fusion is possible and can be beneficial for each individual discipline, by helping refine e.g., economic theories
- NOTE: great book, I should get a copy and read all of it eventually

CHAPTER 1:
- all three disciplines provide a perspective into what guides human choice, although from very different angles (example: two attendants at a conference engage in affair)
- economist: observed choice reveals preferences, preferences are the simplest possible tool to explain choice
- psychologist: takes into account mental state, happiness etc.
- biologist: evolutionary arguments
-> we need a global theory that unites these disciplines

CHAPTER 2:
- discusses philosophical (logical positivist) arguments regarding the reductive synthesis of disciplines a la physics < chemistry < biology
- logical positivist idea: since all we know about the world comes from a common sensory source, all of these kinds of knowledge must be "reduce-able" to a common language/starting point -> ontological reductionism
- ontological challenge to reductionism: reduction of social science is not possible in principle (different levels of description can only be related if they share common logical objects)
- empirical challenge to reductionism: reduction is possible in principle but useless or impossible in practie
- example of pancreas: some higher-level concepts are not predictable from lower level (-> emergent concepts vs. homomorphic concepts)
- it's unclear whether all concepts can be reduced to lower levels (i.e., forge reductions where homomorphic linkages exist), but examining the linkages can inform theory building in each discipline

CHAPTER 3:
- introduces basic economic ideas underlying/leading up to the expected utility framework
- neoclassical revolution: build axiomatic theory about preferences based on observe choices (we observe choices to understand preferences, not the other way around)
- Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP): if you choose A over B, you cannot prefer B over A + more is better than less
- Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP): choosers can never be satiated, introduces rational actor -> implies that behavior can be described by monotonic utility function
- Economic rationality only implies consistent preferences, nothing more and nothing less
- probabilistic outcomes + continuity axiom + independence axiom -> Expected utility theorem

CHAPTER 4:
- describes first links b/w neuroscience, psychology, and economics -> psychology of subjective experience (percept) + Random Utility Models
- e.g., perception of light intensity can be linked to reactivity of rhodopsin to different wavelengths
- e.g., experience of weight of an object (or any other perception) has some variance (e.g., drawn from a normal distribution) -> c.f., signal detection theory
- Weber-Fechner law: magnitude of percepts grows as a power function of objective stimulus intensity, with the size of the exponent of the power function being a different number for each sensory system
-> random utility models are very much related to the description of perception based on objective stimuli!

CHAPTER 5:
- highlight several important decision-related phenomena that are poorly described by early neoclassical approaches (e.g., endowment effect) and review existing responses by economists and psychologists
- 1) deniers argue that phenomena are not significant enough to revise neoclassical theory -> deviations are not a sufficient challenge to the theory
- 2) naysayers argue that we have to abandon the axiomatic thought in favor of empirically driven approach -> heuristics and biases approach, new rule for each decision context
- 3) middle grounders argue that axiomatic models can be revised by adding new adjustable parameters -> e.g., prospect theory, can be useful, but is empirically and theoretically limited -> no econ theory
- 4) the revisers argues that we can use psychological insights to revise axioms -> preferred by author

CHAPTER 6:
- argues against Milton Friedman and others who said that economics doesn't need to care about the underlying mechanism but only provides _as-if_ explanations
- instead, neuroeconomics provides the potential for _because_ explanations that link the axioms of choice to underlying psychological and neurological mechanisms
- e.g., utility in economics can be "reduced" to subjective value in neuroscience (c.f., perception of objective stimuli)

COMMENTS:
- p. 89: different power functions could be related to evolutionary mechanism (harmful > 1, beneficial <1) -> c.f., also risk seeking in the domain of losses or gains
- p. 106: Becker, Marshack, DeGroot (BDM) approach is interesting to get real price preference: as how much R would pay, then draw price at random and sell if it's lower or equal than stated price
- p. 111: that figure is wrong no?
- p. 136: what happened to psych?},

  note    = {PsyArXiv},
  year    = {2018},
  comment = {overview:
- basic argument: sharing hostile political rumors is not based on partisan motivations but rather based on an underlying "need for chaos"
- important distinction: sharing is not equal believing in rumors
- sharing has the instrumental function of creating support against the establishment regardless of political party -> mobilization tool

analyses/results:
- multiple representative & convenience samples in US and Denmark
1) violent activism increases willingness to share rumprs regardless of partisanship, legal activism does not -> issue w/ design, what if legal activists only share partisan?
2) violent activists don't share hostile political rumors to defend targets or because they think they are true but rather to mobilize -> Q: what does the negative effect of belief mean?
3) NFC as a psychological trait predicts sharing rumors -> measurement could be problematic, esp. w/ trolls
4) those high in need for chaos are status-obsessed and socially marginalized -> trolls?

questions/comments:
- need for chaos as a trait or state? seems more context-dependent no?
- p.7 sounds like partisan motivation implies system support. Not sure if that makes sense
- does NFC go beyond traditional forms of democratic discontent such as political cynicism/populism
- there is somewhat of a conceptual disconnect since people hight in NFC are argued not to care about ingroup but just want to see the world burn, yet the definition of violent activists (those who are high in NFC) is based on R's willingness to engage in violence to defend group},

  comment   = {overview:
- conventional methods for TCSC data (ADL etc.) can only produce valid inferences for lagged effects under strong asssumptions (baseline randomized treatments, essentially implies that the entire treatment history is randomized at t=0)
- more common: sequential ignorability assumption, which implies that the treatment is randomly assigned at each point in time and can be affected by past values of the covariates and the outcome -> selection on observables!
- paper defines causal quantities of interest (effect of treatment history, contemporaneous effect of treatment, impulse response, step response)
- authors propose two methods that are better than standard ADL under sequential ignorability assumption:
1) Structural nested mean models
2) Marginal structural models
- both models perform better than ADL, each has specific advantages and disadvantages, see paper for details

comments:
- the procedures are discussed in the context of TSCS data, but I am wondering to what extent the same arguments apply for pure time-series data (i.e., one country, etc.)?

- new approach to measuring and comparing strategic voting across voters that can be broadly applied given appropriate survey data -> understand inequalities in strategic voting behavior across types of voters
- measure of tactical incentives: identifies voters for whom a tactical vote would produce a better expected election outcome than a sincere vote
- strategic responsiveness: captures how much more likely voters are to cast a tactical vote when a tactical vote would benefit them and when it would not
- application: BES 2005, 2010 -> no difference in strategic voting by education level, but older/richer/left-leaning voters are more strategic
- age and income differences in strategic voting exacerbates inequalities in political participation
-> approach reveals less about voters' thought process, but more about possible differences in voters' ability to obtain desired outcomes in elections (irrespective of underling thought process)

comments:
- really interesting paper and method!
- it seems weird that education/knowledge does not have effects on strategic responsiveness, no?
- extension 1: experimentally varying available information and examine strategic responsiveness (c.f., conclusion)

  comment   = {overview:
- regression discontinuity analysis of districts where women barely won or lost an election -> examine effect on women turnout and women running for office in subsequent elections
- election of additional women in competitive US state legislative elections has no discernible causal effects on other women's political participation at the mass or elite level

theoretical argument:
- past research has argued that increasing political empowerment among women in the mass public should help close gender gaps in political participation
- "women candidates send the signal that politics is no longer an exclusive man's world"
- but, this effect might diminish after the first cohort of pathbreaking female role models are elected; if female officeholding is already fairly common, then the empowering gains might be lower
-> while the mobilizing effect has been shown in other contexts (e.g., India), electing women in the United States may not have the same effect of breaking down barriers to equal representation in gov't that American women face

results:
- Women appear on the ballot more frequently after winning the previous election (this result is almost trivial)
- Electing a women in a district has no effect on women's voter turnout (or women's share in of the electorate) in the next election
- A woman's victory in one district has no effect on the number of women candidates (running or winning) in nearby districts in subsequent elections

questions/comments:
- the article looks at the effect of successful women candidates on subsequent participation, but what about mobilizing effects in the first election?
- external validity issues:
   - RD only estimates local average treatment effect (around the discontiuity)
   - "RD approach is restricted in its generalizability to a smaller set of cases (competitive elections), but it is precisely these cases where existing theoretical work typcally predicts the effects would be likeliest to materialize" -> is that really the case?
   - what about the selection bias to run for office in the district in the first place? -> limited to areas where women already tend to be nominated for offices that they can plausibly win
   - what about other races/different levels of government? e.g., congressional races?
- internal validity issues:
   - bandwith of 15 percentage point margin (35-65) doesn't appear very narrow tbh},

- rational choice as a measure of the quality of choice
- Intro Neumann and Morgenstern expected utility

CHAPTER 2: What Is Decision-Making?
- decision involves (1) more than one possibnle course of action, (2) expectations concerning future events, (3) possible outcomes can be assessed on an evaluative continuum
- rational expectations principle
- primacy effects and sunk costs fallacy

CHAPTER 4: The Fundamental Judgment Strategy
- anchoring bias and insufficient adjustment

CHAPTER 5: Judging Heuristically
- biased sampling from memory, availability heuristics
- people don't understand probability: base rate neglect etc.
- representative heuristic

CHAPTER 11: A Rational Decision Theory
- more details on Neumann/Morgenstern's expected utility framework
- discusses the axioms of expected utility framework -> defining rationality as behavior that satisfies the axioms

CHAPTER 12: A Descriptive Decision Theory
- expected utility theory is not a valid descriptive theory of human behavior -> create a more adequate descriptive theory: prospect theory
- 2 stages in prospect theory: (1) editing the alternatives (constructing cognitive representation, ...), and (2) evaluation (valuation, decision weighting, integration)
- evaluation via value function: reference-level dependence, gains and losses satiate, loss aversion
- individual decision weights deviate from objective probability

- differentiates two tyes of knowledge: factual vs. political knowledge structure density (!)
- useful quote (p. 219): "These findings further demonstrate the importance of considering structural knowledge as a distinct component of political knowledge beyond the more traditionally used measures of factual knowledge."

knowledge structure density (KSD): 
- defined as the extent to which individuals see connections or relationships among various concepts within the political domian--issues, individuals, or organizations
- measures the interconnectedness of a particular domain within the cognitive network of an individual

  volume    = {forthcoming},
  pages     = {1--14},
  comment   = {Overview:
- natural experiment + survey on Greek islands affected by influx of refugees from Turkey -> distance from Turkey as instrument for refugee exposure
- "direct exposure to refugee arrivals insuces increases in natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies"
- "since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility"

Method:
- Natural experiment comparing Greek islands that were exposed to refugees vs. islands that were not; distance to Turkish coast was used as an instrument to solve endogeneity issues
- identical survey (N ca. 2000) conducted on multiple islands asking for attitudes, policy preferences and political engagement (multiple items for certain categories combined via PCA), conducted well after refugees left
- 2SLS + various robustness and placebo tests, the analyses seem pretty solid
- potential mechanisms: natives affected by tourism (no) effects determined by predisposition (no, they're pretty uniform)  

Comments:
- in their argument, endogeneity is based on the refugees' decision where to land (i.e., in more "friendly" territory), which does not seem like the only source of endogeneity
- I'm not sure if I buy their argument that the findings challenge economic and cultural explanations. The authors suggest a clear distinction b/w these previous theories and the threat from passing refugees, which I find less clear than they suggest
- are there other factors related to distance & refugee attitudes which might confound the relationship? I thought so, but the placebo tests (comparing pre-exposure islands) suggest otherwise
- literature review might be useful, e.g., when they discuss how contact b/w ingroups and outgroups can reduce prejudice if both share equal status and common goals, find themselves in a cooperative rather than competitive environment, and operate under a well-defined set of norms or regulations. Also arguments regarding the role of knowledge, perspective-taking, etc. -> proximity does not necessarily lead to contact!},

- Puzzle: why do priorities for combating public risks seem uncorrelated with the dangers those risks objectively present?
- "Americans' risk priorities primarily reflect judgments about the extent to which some victims deserve more protection than others and the degree to which it is appropriate for government to intervene in different areas of social life"
-> "key to understanding Americans' divergent reactions to risk lies more with their values than with their grasp of factual information."

Method:
- Survey asking respondents to complete 15 pairwise comparisons between public risks on multiple dimensions (priority, harm, mortality, fairness, responsibility, disaster potential, long-term growth, worry)
- analysis based on aggregation of individual paired comparisons.

Findings:
- Respondents are well informed about (relatve) magnitude of risks, but those perceptions explained relatively little variation in policy preferences
- Instead, what matters is the relative status of the victim and the appropriate role of government
-> we need to distinguish between factual beliefs and policy preferences, key to productive discourse likely lies in understanding voters' values rather than contesting their factual beliefs. 

Comments/Questions:
- Main priority measure seems problematic: More money than currently or more money than the other risk? The baseline is unclear!
- Accurate relative risk perception does not necessarily imply accurate *absolute* risk perception...},

- seven original survey experiments (various US samples) that "randomly assign respondents to receive or not receive accurate information about the prevalence of immigrants before reporting attitudes about immigrants and immigration policy"
- information corrects misperception (i.e., reduces estimated size of immigrant population) but only has little and inconsistent impact on attitudes about immigration
- finding is not consistent with theories of power or intergroup threat (they argue it doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the theory itself, but rather suggests that there may be other cognitive mechanisms that explain why people perceive an out-group as threatening)
- "Misperceptions about the size of minority groups may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of attitudes toward those groups." 

Method:
- survey experiment (estimate foreign born X correct info)
- DV: attitudes towards immigrants, econ/culture threat

- analysis of multiple CCES waves (2006-2014), examines the effect of women candidates and officeholders on political knowledge, interest, and participation
- main argument: most evidence of the effect of descriptive representation on women's empowerment is drawn from surveys from the 1980s and 1990s
- knoweldge: "both men and women are more politically knowledgeable when represented by women in Congress and in state government."
- engagement: "little evidence that women are more politically interested or participatory when residing in places with more female officeholders or candidates"
-> descriptive representation has modest effects on political knowledge among other women, but little unique benefit specifically for women as gender gaps are not reduced

- "cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their productive potential to help one another"
- paper describes simple rules/mechanisms to allow for cooperation to develop despite the fact that natural selection implies competition
- last part develops a framework to show when each mechanism leads to cooperation being an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), risk dominant (RD), or advantageous (AD).

5 mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation:
- kin selection: donor and recipient of altruistic act are genetic relatives
- direct reciprocity: repeated encounters b/w the same two individuals
- indirect reciprocity: reputation, a helpful individual is more likely to receive help
- network reciprocity: clusters of cooperators outcompete defectors
- group selection / multilevel selection: competition is not only between individuals but also between groups

  number    = {1},
  pages     = {5--26},
  volume    = {6},
  comment   = {overview:
- efficient incentive-compatible schemes to provide public goods always include a residual profit and thereby provide an incentive for leaders to exaggerate the cost of the public good
- property right to the residual creates a stake in inefficiency for leaders
- "Economic efficiency in the presence of externalitics requires the resolution of a fundamentally political problem: the credible commitment of central officials to the implementation of an efficient incentive scheme that is not in their own best interest."
- Incentive-compatible mechanisms can never overcome politics because there is always a conflict between ruler self-interest and economic efficiency

basic argument:
- with public goods,there seem to be built-in incentives for misrepresentation of preferences, people want to underreport how much they value the public good in order to pay less of the burden
- incentive-compatible mechanisms have been proposed to overcome this issue by creating incentives for citizens to reveal their true valuation of the public good
- but: while these mechanisms eliminate the incentives to lie among citizens, they create incentives to lie for rulers (i.e., misrepresent the total value of the public good to increase residual profit)
- therefore, incentive-compatible mechanisms cannot overcome the inevitability of politics

incentive-compatible scheme no.1:
- taxation for individual i is equal to the total cost of the public good minus the other's contribution
- this creates an incentive for both to truthfully report how much they value the public good
- however, this mechanism will guarantee that the central decision-maker will receive insufficient funds to pay for the public good -> budget-balancing problem: the center must run a deficit if the project is efficient
- the only way to make sure that the residual is positive is for the center to exaggerate the total cost of the public good, but this creates an incentive to lie an take the profits

incentive-compatible scheme no.2:
- introduce a minimum tax payment for each individual even if the public good is not provided
- taxing even if the project is not adopted creates an incentive for truthfulness among citizens and makes sure the center receives sufficient funds
- this scheme can guarantee a profit for the center but only by imposing losses on the subordinates
- but: the center still has incentives to misreveal the costs of the project and to make inefficient project decisions
-> trade-off between center profit and overall efficiency still persists

conclusion / good quotes:
- "the academic search for a mechanism that would allow the center to have the information it needs to make efficient decisions has succeeded in finding these mechanisms. However, the implementation of this mechanism would require the center itself to withstand a constant temptation to lie and make inefficient decisions."
- "The implications seem to be that a resolution of the problem of hidden information is impossible given both profit-maximization by the center and individual rationality by employees."
- "The obstacle to efficiency in public-good provision is the self-interest of leaders who can generate larger net revenues with other schemes."
- "The correct interpreta- tion of the literature on incentive compatibility and its problems with budget-balancing is that it provides a way of understanding the necessity of political conflict and constitutional struggle, not a way of circumventing politics."
- "no smoothly-running, apolitical system of self-interested actors can supply an efficient level of public goods."

- monetary incentives (fees, fines, etc. to induce cooperation) can crowd out social norms which can create socially less desirable outcomes

-> instead of adhering to norms, the parents now had a "price" for being late, which they were willing to pay
- a constitution made for "knaves" produces individuals who act purely self-interested...
- mechanism design and incentive-compatible institutions fail to take into account the imortant role of social norms and can therefore lead to results that are socially undesirable

  comment   = {overview:
- formal model (extension of agency model and electoral politics) shows "why fully rational voters, though certain that incumbents spend less on disaster prevention than is good for them, reelect incumbents at very high rates [...] [and] punish incumbents who spend more on disaster prevention."
- voters cannot enforce an equilibrium in which incumbents pursue prevention if and only if it is beneficial for voters.
- 1 main equilibrium: both types of incumbents (honest and corrupt) pursue any prevention projects as it would signal corruption
- equilibrium with socially inefficient low levels of prevention do not require myopic/irrational voters but can simply be a product of rational actors and information assymmetries.
-> "political obstacles to rational prevention policy are at once more fundamental and more insidious than previous research recognizes
-> Insufficient prevention can be a product of myopic voters as well as rational voters, which means that low levels of prevention cannot be used as direct evidence for either. This has implications for future empirical analyses (to distinguish both options) as well as policy-making (to achieve socially desirable levels of prevention)
- "in a realistic information environment, an electoral agency model with fully rational but asymmetrically informed voters is observa- tionally equivalent to a model with irrational voters (e.g., myopic voters)--and both yield pathological prevention policy."
- "In short, we suggest that future empirical analysis should focus on cases in which the rational agency model and myopic (or otherwise irrational) voter models imply different behavior." -> rational model with asymmetric information also produces policy pathologies, but it calls for very different remedies.

model assumptions:
- all prevention policies entail an up-front cost
- prevention policies vary in their stream of future benefits to voters.
- incumbent politicians observe more information than voters about the expected benefits of a given prevention policy
- incumbents vary in the degree to which they themselves benefit from spending on prevention, even when it is not effective

questions/comments;
- great article, prime example of a useful formal model
- how much can we learn from the preventing prevention equilibrium if it does not resemble the real world in the sense that politicians differ in the degree to which they want to enact prevention policies? In their equilibrium, corrupt types always mimic honest types, which seems like a crucial deviation from the real world},

- question: is polarization a cause of media fragmentation or rather an effect fo media fragmentation? Causal direction is not completely clear in the literature
- major issue in past research: unable to disentangle the effect of selective exposure and actual persuasion
- Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment (PICA) design, includes free choice and forced exposure of partisan media sources (Fox News, MSNBC, entertainment)
- design allows authors to estimate the degree of polarization caused by selective exposure and the persuasive effect of partisan media, as well as sensitivityanalyses accounting for discrepancies between stated preferences and actual choice
- exposire to more partisan news can sway opinions of even those respondents who are already exposed to some degree of partisan news, but they are most effective among respondents who usually prefer entertainment rather than partisan news
- "We ﬁnd that partisan media can polarize both its regular consumers and inadvertent audiences who would otherwise not consume it, but ideologically opposing media potentially also can ameliorate the existing polarization between consumers."
-> polarization is not simply a function of selective exposure, persuasion effects play an important role as well

comments/questions:
- interesting and useful article that can serve as a template for future persuasion/exposure studies
- design is almost the same as in our lab project implementing a randomized exposure + endogenous exposure design, but we keep the actual content of the news article constant, which could be an interesting extension

- data: Australian panel used by Smith et al. 2017, MTurk panel (2014-2018), ANES 2008-2009 panel

analyses:
1) comparing stability of MFQ and ideology using different measurment approaches: ideology is more stable regardless of measurement approach
2) cross-lagged panel analysis (akin to testing Granger causality): lagged ideology is predictive of moral foundations (controlling for lagged moral foundations), but not vice versa
3) random forest analysis, comparing predictive importance: ideology higher predictive importance for moral foundations than vice versa

questions/comments:
- overall good review of the debate, includes some useful citations
- good discussion of the extent to which the analyses indeed show causality (especially in conclusion) and to what extent there are still limitations (e.g., because they cannot rule out spuriousness)
- Ultimately, this comes down to an argument about measurement. From a pure theoretical perspective, it seems more plausible that moral considerations are causally prior to ideology and political beliefs (think about child socialization etc.). However, the evidence definitely suggests that ideology measures are more stable and predictive of moral foundations. The question is whether we should draw a conclusion about MFQ as a measurement or about morality in general? I agree regarding the former but I'm not quite convinced regarding the latter.},

- proposes a general design for patient preference trials (PPTs) that involves a combination of forced exposure and free choice condition for media exposure experiments
- motivation: "If a treatment has different effects on those who would choose to take it and those who would not, the average treatment effect estimated in a standard randomized controlled trial (RCT) may give a misleading picture of its impact outside of the study sample."
- key causal quantity: ACTE: average choice-specific treatment effect, represents the conditional average treatment effect for the sub-population of subjects who would choose a particular treatment option
- ACTE is identified under (1) randomization of designs, (2) randomization of the forced treatment, and (3) mean ignorability of measurement error (i.e., the discrepancy between stated and revealed preferences is ignorable / not correlated with background characteristics that are associated with potential outcomes
- Assumption 3 is key (and strong in certain contexts), the framework allows for sensitivity analysis of its violation

questions/comments:
- no-design-effect assumption is important, our lab project essentially argues that a nominally identical treatment has different effects on the outcome for the same unit depending on whether the treatment was randomly assigned in the forced exposure condition or voluntary chosen in the free-choice condition -> Essentially we are arguing that this key assumption is violated, which would be an interesting methodological contribution.},

advantages of embedding models over scaling based on pure word frequency (e.g., wordscore, wordfish):
- can account for the evolution of language over time
- allows to map political actors in a multi-dimensional space
- ability to include control variables is useful to account for the effect of institutional characteristics
- words and phrases closest to the location of the party can help researchers to interpret the meaning of each axis.

  comment   = {overview:
- basic public goods game in the control condition, treatment condition adds an additional payment depending on the group's relative performance
- cooperation in public goods games is increased in the presence of group competition
- with group competition participants tended to regard their group mates more as collaborators than competitors.
- level of cooperation can be influenced by proximate emotions (guilt, anger, and perception of common purpose with the group), which vary with the degree of intergroup competition.
- quote in discussion: "it is hard to say if our participants contributed more under group competition because they either believed that this would make them more money (even though on average it had no effect), or because they were strongly motivated by a sense of competition and wanted their group to 'win.'" -> That's the important question though!

questions/comments:
- straightforward experiment. However, besides inducing group competition, the manipulation also changes the overall payoffs of the experiment. Hence, it is not clear whether participants cooperate because of the monetary incentives or because of an intrinsic desire for their group to "win" -> this can be addressed by adding a social identity / partisanship component
- might be worth checking some of their citations.},

  pages     = {1--17},
  volume    = {37},
  comment   = {overview:
- review of behavioral games that examine inter/intra-group conflict/cooperation
- 2 factors that influence cooperation/conflict: game harmony (measure proposed by authors, based on payoff correlation) and situational group factors (group salience, common fate, group formation)
- 3 potential mediating factors for cooperation in groups: communication, procedural fairness, crowding out of intrinsic incentives
- discussion: "For natural groups, it is difﬁcult to decompose the role of strategic incentives from psychological processes (e.g. team reasoning and perceived game harmony), while controlling for sample selection effects."
- conclusion: "On another note, it is important to determine speciﬁc conditions under which framing manipu- lations increase both intra-group cooperation and inter-group conﬂict, and conditions under which it increases either intra-group cooperation or inter-group conflict."

results (based on review):
- game harmony and cooperation in games are positively correlated
- perceived game harmony (influenced by group identity etc.) and cooperation rates in games are positively correlated
- group salience and intra-group cooperation and/or inter-group conflict are positively correlated: common fate & minimal group manipulations increase intra-group cooperation, common fate manipulations increase inter-group conflict

questions / comments:
- game harmony may be useful, not sure how common it is though
- interesting overview, maybe some useful cites, but not particularly insightful tbh},

- definition post-truth (Oxford Dictionary 2016): "relating to or denoting circum- stances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping
public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief"
-> distinct from the concept of fake news, which involves the deliberate portrayal and pread of false information
-> "foundation for post-truth is laid when people consider opinion to be as legitimate as objective facts, or when they weigh emotional factors as heavily as statistical evidence."

features that characterize post-truth:
- relies on appeals to emotions (fear, anger etc)
- separate fact from specific details of a policy, i.e., feelings about one issue inform debates about an unrelated issue
- repetition is effective
- rebuttals are ignored or dismissed

basic factors used to assess the truth:
- compatibility
- coherence
- credibility
- consensus
- support

environmental factors that exacerbate post-truth:
- overall loss of trust in institutions, including the media
- massive changes in the way we obtain information
-> narratives that are rich with emotion are more persuasive than scientific logic etc.},

- examines how information changes as it flows from official reports to news outlets to other people

- study 1: participants read a news story about economic performance during Trump administration and are asked to describe the content to another person
- study 2: compare learning and attitude change based on social information (comparing informed/uninformed co- & out-partisans)

resuts summary:
- information communicated by the media is about twice as similar to the official source than information communicated by other people
- participants exposed to socially generated information learned significantly less than participants exposed to information from the media
- but: information from an ideal informant (highly informed co-partisan) is as effective as media info
- social information does not appear to affect economic confidence, but it can affect presidential approval

comments:
- great idea and comparatively simple implementation (in terms of measurement etc.). Lots of potential extensions to think about.},

- introduces experimental design to study how information is disseminated from news article, to person, to person -> modeling information transmission as a game of telephone
- P1 reads article and writes a message, P2 reads message and writes another one, P3 reads that message and writes a last one -> comparison of messages
- all participants were blind to characteristics about the people whom they received messages from and to whom they sent messages
- 2 outcomes (manually coded): amount of information in each message and distortion of that information
- finding: amount of information declines and distortion increases further down the chain (but no blatantly wrong information)

possible extensions discussed in conclusion:
- how do individuals reaggregate information from multiple sources?
- how do individuals self-select into diffusion chains?
- how do individuals tailor the information shared with others conditional on anticipated agreement / disagreement?
- motivated reasoning based on source?},

- field experiment in Denmark, 2-wave panel with leaflet intervention informing citizens about burglary rates

- conclusion: "Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic."

questions/comments
- theoretical discussion includes a couple of citations to suggest that misperceptions are easy to correct in the lab. check again for literature review
- woth checking out the study appendix for ideas on how to effectively visualize statistical corrective information in experiments

- decrease in MTurk data quality is driven by participants from outside the US using VPS to mask their IP location (rather than bots being the issue)
- these respondents provide particularly low-quality data, often don't respond to experimental manipulations (diminishes treatment effects)
- paper provides 3 solutions: 1) software to identify fraud in existing datasets, 2) an easy-to-use web application based on this software, and 3) a method for blocking fraudulent respondents in qualtrics surveys
-> IP-based measure is highly effective at identifying low-quality respondents (IP location as a proxy is more problematic)

- best practices for MTurk mentioned in the paper: HIT Approval >95%, HITS Approved > 100)
- always use minimum of 100 hits accepted on MTurk, otherwise approval rate will always be 100%},

- panel survey of undergraduate students during Iraq war -> changing information about the conflict (WMDs & casualties)
- provides conceptual distinction between factual beliefs, interpretations, and opinions
- examines "whether and how partisans updated factual beliefs, interpretations of beliefs, and opinions"
- people change their beliefs if facts change but "interpretations varied across partisan groups in predictable ways. In turn, interpretations, not beliefs, drove opinions."

Models of Complete and Incomplete Updating Processes
a.  Complete Updating: reality -> beliefs ->  interpretations ->  opinions
b.  Fact Avoidance:  reality || beliefs -> interpretations ->  opinions
c.  Meaning Avoidance reality ->  beliefs ||  interpretations ->  opinions
d. Opinion Disconnect reality ->  beliefs -> interpretations || opinions

results:
- "although all five partisan groups updated beliefs in a similar fashion, they diverged in opinions"
- "partisan groups differed considerably in how they mapped causality beliefs into interpretations"
- strong democrats and independents behave cosistently with model a (complete updating); Republicans behave consistently with model c (meaning avoidance)
-> "However, that people update their factual beliefs need not imply that they update their opinions accordingly."
- "In any case, the findings underline the importance of interpretations in citizens’ evaluations of policy consequences. Factual beliefs are certainly an element of how people see their political worlds, perhaps especially when the pertinent facts hit them between the eyes. But their interpretations of those beliefs count more."},

  abstract   = {Even if people acknowledge that misinformation is incorrect after a correction has been presented, their feelings towards the source of the misinformation can remain unchanged. The current study investigated whether participants reduce their support of Republican and Democratic politicians when the prevalence of misinformation disseminated by the politicians appears to be high in comparison to the prevalence of their factual statements. We presented U.S. participants either with (1) equal numbers of false and factual statements from political candidates or (2) disproportionately more false than factual statements. Participants received fact-checks as to whether items were true or false, then rerated both their belief in the statements as well as their feelings towards the candidate. Results indicated that when corrected misinformation was presented alongside equal presentations of affirmed factual statements, participants reduced their belief in the misinformation but did not reduce their feelings towards the politician. However, if there was considerably more misinformation retracted than factual statements affirmed, feelings towards both Republican and Democratic figures were reduced—although the observed effect size was extremely small.},
  comment    = {overview:
- misinfo can be corrected, but attitudes don't change unless there is considerable more (fact-checked) misinformation than affirmed factual statements (even then effects are small) -> ratio of misinfo/factual matters
- overall, there appears to be mostly symmetry in how supporters of Trump vs. Sanders react (e.g., both are not able to differentiate between factual statement and misinfo prior to receiving the fact-check, although it should be noted that the Sanders-misinfo is qualitatively different from Trump-misinfo). But: supporters of Trump believed significantly more in Trump misinformation than non-supporters, even after receiving corrective info.
- corrective misinformation did not change participants' view of a politician's general veracity, they are bad at keeping a running tally of inaccuracies

design:
- experiment showing actual statements by Trump/Sanders (some factual, some misinfo), varied the ratio of factual vs. misinfo statements
- atttitudes / beliefs measured pre and post fact-check
- supporter/non-supporter distinction based on feeling-thermometer split
- 2(ratio manipulation)x2(Trump/Sanders)x2(Supporter/non-supporter)x2(pre/post fact check) between-within design
- sample: 1,500 MTurk respondents

comments/questions:
- shows useful examples of how to present corrective information for future experimental designs
- analysis clearly done by psychologist, lots of ANOVAs with three-way interactions
- Q: this study focuses on change in feeling towards source (i.e., the politician making false statement) rather than the change in feeling towards the target (i.e., the object the false statement is about, c.f., Hopkins 2019 JOP). Important difference?
- possible citation to argue that corrective information is frequently found to change factual beliefs but not attitudes},

- main idea: core beliefs (over which people have a desired conclusion) distort auxiliary beliefs (that people do not care about but that are related to the core belief).
- "The degree to which auxiliary beliefs get distorted is directly tied to how closely related they are to core beliefs" as well as how much the agent cares about his conclusion about the core variable 
-> "Many 'nonrational' ideas about belief formation from psychology that have been applied heavily to political science and economics arise naturally when cast as a maximization problem with accuracy and directional goals."

  comment   = {overview (only skimmed):
- generate estimates of American's preferences on the minimum wage and compare them to observed policies botth within and across states
- preferences and policies are measured on the same scale ($), which allows the authors to quantify the association of policy outcomes with preferences across states (responsiveness) and theior deviation within states (bias)
- useful conceptual distinction between responsiveness (relationship between public opinion and policy outcomes across states) and congruence (whether or not individual policies in a jurisdiction are supported by the majority)

findings:
- while there is evidence for responsiveness, policy outcomes tend to be more conservative than preferences in each state
- policy bias is substantially smaller in states with access to direct democratic institutions

questions/comments:
- findings are somewhat driven by anchoring due to the fact that respondents received information about the actual minimum wage in their state. However, they have a supplementary analysis using federal minimum wage which ostensibly yields similar results},

- analyses using administrative records (e.g., stop and frisk data) to estimate racial discrimination in police behavior (e.g., use of force) are statistically biases (unless there is no racial discrimination when choosing whom to investigate (i.e., whom to stop in the first place)
- fundamental problem is post-treatment bias (due to mediation and selection), police administrative records lack information on civilians that police observe but do not invesitgate
- DAG: D (minority) -> M (stop) -> Y (force), problem is we're only observing stops!
- paper presents bias-corrected bounds of treatment effects as well as a research design to oovercome missing data issue (i.e., info on people who were not stopped) based on traffic controls
- defines different causal quantities in the context of biased policing, very useful conceptual framework
- substantive example: re-analysis of Fryer (2019), which uncerestimated racial bias in SQF use of force
- important: the bias always downplays the extent of racially discriminatory policing!

comment:
- useful argument for SQF project: "quantifying the causal eect of civilian race on police behavior—our task here—is imperative regardless of the mechanism that produces such an eect." (p.9)},

  comment   = {observations for the future of political misinformation research:
1) Persistent debates about what constitutes "fake news" and distinctions between other types of false information are mostly distracting: too much attention to definitional issues etc.
2) To what extent does false information actually matter politically? Who is exposed to it, where, and to what effect?: we don't fully understand how frequently people encounter false information in their everyday lives, existing research suggests that exposure may be minimal(!)
3) Exposure and belief in false information depends a lot on our social connections but we haven't paid much attention to that yet: many individuals are likely exposed to misinformation through frineds and family members etc.
4) Politicians, elites, and government officials are major (but understudied) sources of false information
5) Emotions play a critical role in promoting exposure to, engagement with, and belief in misinformation: e.g., much of the political misinformation in curculation plays on negative emotions like anger
6) How do we confront and stop misinformation?

comments/questions:
- a couple of good citations and basic arguments for follow-up projects:
1) examining open-ended responses to evaluate the pervasisveness of misinformation
2) role of social connections in disseminating false information & correct information
3) number of likes etc. as a reputation mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of information
4) lack of external validity of many laboratory studies because people do not actively seek out fact-checking messages and rarely encounter them when using social media},

- analyze web-browsing histories for 50,000 US-located users who regularly read online news (tracked through bing toolbar add-on in IE explorer)
- media slant is measured based on the outlet level not at the article level
- ideological segregation is defined as the expected difference in the conservative shares of news outlets visited by two randomly selected individuals (somewhat confusing)
- higher segregation is the result of individuals choosing only publications that are ideologically similar to each other, rarely reading opposing perspectives (rather than reading across the board while still having a left- or right-leaning preference)
- 4 consumption channels: direct, aggregator, social, search

main findings:
1) social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals (ideological segregation)
2) social networks and search engines are also associated with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum
3) the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets
-> evidence for both sides of the debate whether thechnological changes increase exposure to diverse perspective or create cho chambers!

limitations:
- news slant measured on outlet rather than article level
- focus on news consumption itself, not political behavior
- it is possible that stories that have the greates impact on such outcomes are disproportionately discovered via social networks or search engines
- study focused on subpopulation of active news consumers
- defining causation in this setting is a difficult issue

questions/comments:
- useful citation when discussing the existence of eco chambers and filter bubbles!
- great discussion of the procedures (e.g., to identify news and opinion articles, infreeing consumption channels through url history) + useful cites!
- media slant measure is problematic since regional variation in ideology is confounded by regional variation in education levels (see washington post)
- creative strategies (e.g., to estimate ideological slant based on regional variation in viewership)
- selection bias / lack of representativeness and measurement error are the two most important issues
- none of the plots or tables convey any sense of the uncertainty around the estimates!},

- wave of local television station acquisitions by a conglomerate owner (SInclair media) lead to (1) increases in coverage of national politics at the expense of local politics, (2) a rightward shift in the ideological slant of coverage, and (3) a small decrease in viewership (relative to changes at other news programs airing in the same media markets)
-> "These results suggest a substantial supply-side role in the trends toward nationalization and lolarization of politics news, with negative implications for accountability of local elected officials and mass polarization."
- analysis/design: diff-in-diff comparing the content and viewership of 743 local news stations over the latter two-thirds of 2017 (acquisition of some stations by Sinclair occured Sep 1, 2017).
- political content is identified using LDA topic model (which is somewhat problematic, prone to measurement error etc.), but the authors show several robustness checks to make sure that their results are not driven by this specification


questions/comments:
- great discussion of results and plenty of robustness checks using alternative specifications etc.
- check procedure/citation to measure ideological slant
- maybe use acquisition of SInclair as a predictor of political attitudes/behavior across region? RDD/natural experiment?},

main findings:

- information about the true shares and origins of immigrants is ineffective and mainly acts as a prime that makes people think more about immigrants and reduces their support for redisptribution

- the ideal of deliberative democracy cannot be achieved in large societies (too many individuals, decisions, choices, etc.)

- "Some of the public policy implications of that insight are rather banal. Of course democracy naturally requires well-stocked public libraries and public funding of the art" (106)
- Internal deliberation can improve external-collective decision procedures by "Democratizing our internal reflections-rendering them more expansive and more empathetic-contributes to the democratic quality of the process as well, making it more democratically deliberative." (109)

- three classes of positive attributes, or individual-level characteristics, that potentially foster citizen competence: knowing, thinking, and trying. These refer, respectively, to citizens’ stores of relevant information, their capacity for reasoning and critical judgment, and their willingness to put effort in to completion of the tasks of citizenship
- evidence regarding the relative contributions of knowing, thinking, and trying to levels of citizen competence, and, more broadly, the empirical tests will provide initial insight as to the utility of conceiving of citizen competence and its possible antecedents in this manner

3 components of competence:
- knowing: civics + current events as separate dimensions
- thinking: what is needed is critical thinking ability—a capacity related to, or alternately labeled as, intelligence, analytical ability, and cognitive ability.
- trying: motivation, effort, grit, political interest -> conceptualization remains a bit vague

  comment   = {overview:
- reviews evidence against the traditional view that people are easily manipulated by propaganda (e.g., prior to violent protests etc)
- author argues that human psychology contains mechanisms for avoiding manipulation and propaganda is mostly ineffective
- "Instead, we can understand decisions to follow demagogic leaders and circulate fringe rumprs as attempts to solve a social problem inherent to mobilization processes: The coordination problem. Essentially, these decisions  reflect attempts to align the attention of individuals already disposed for conflict."
- "The primary function of fringe beliefs is thus not epistemic but social: They serve as a signal to others about your allegiances."
- interesting example: moral principles as a propaganda tactic that also facilitates coordination
-> propaganda is about coordination, not manipulation (which is generally ineffective since psychological designs that guard against manipulation should create fitness advantages)!

comments/questions:
- very useful review to think about fake news in a broader framework, check citations in the article!
- overall argument is appealing, but needs further empirical validation. There are some interesting observable implications that should be tested (e.g., that fringe beliefs are not "practical beliefs" in the sense that they change behavior)},

  volume     = {71},
  comment    = {overview:
- Abstract: "Truth judgments reflect inferences drawn from three types of information: base rates, feelings, and consistency with information retrieved from memory. First, people exhibit a bias to accept incoming information, because most claims in our environments are true. Second, people interpret feelings, like ease of processing, as evidence of truth. And third, people can (but do not always) consider whether assertions match facts and source information stored in memory."
1) base rates: bias to say true (since most information is true), bias to believe in images
2) feelings-as-information: affect and fluency influence truth assessment
3) memories: consistency with existing knowolege and source information stored in memory (but: fluency supercedes knowledge)

consequences for effective ways to correct misinformation:
- misconceptions are difficult to correct
- appealing to people's base rates and adding visuals in corrections may make them more compelling
- messages should avoid reinforcing feelings associated with myths (e.g., negating misinformation makes it fluent; saying that vaccines do not cause autism reinforces the link)
- leverage people's desire for consistency with their knowledge and beliefs
- use disfluency to cue analytical thinking
- mainstream advice to consider the source misses the mark, since they overestimate people's ability to keep track of sources
- tagging some fake-news stories as false can boost the perceived accuracy of untagged ones (implied truth effect)
-> better solution may be crowdsourced judgments about source trustworthiness

comments/questions:
- focuses on judgments about objective truths, not attitudes! Important conceptual distinction from persuasion literature
- great review article, defintiely check out the references
- the premise that most information is true and people are not good at detecting untruths directly contradicts the premis in Michael Bang Petersen's recent piece on the signalling function of obscure beliefs

SUMMARY POINTS (cp)
1. In everyday life, accurate claims outnumber inaccurate ones. People exhibit a bias to accept incoming information (i.e., to judge claims to be true) that reflects these base rates.
2. Subjectivefeelingsconveyusefulinformationabouttheworld.Thus,weinfertruthfrom feelings like easy processing and our own affect.
3. Relevant facts and memories about the source of a claim can be completely diagnostic of the truth. As a result, people believe statements that match information retrieved from memory and reject inconsistencies.
4. Considering these three classes of inference—from base rates, feelings, and consistency—can improve approaches to correcting misconceptions.

FUTURE ISSUES
1. Shortcuts other than fluency (e.g., affect), as well as reliance on external memory aids like Google, are understudied. 
2. Interactions between cues (e.g.,affect and source) also deserve more empirical attention (see Figure 1). 
3. Cues for truth and falseness may not be simple inverses. Strategies analogous to recalling-to-reject, for example, lend themselves to labeling claims as false but not as true. 
4. Few data speak to how older adults judge truth, and even fewer address childhood. A life-span perspective is crucial, as older adults shared the most fake news in the 2016 election (Grinberg et al. 2019, Guess et al. 2019).
5. Most existing studies use behavioral measures, but cognitive neuroscience can probe processes unavailable to conscious awareness. 
6. Current multinomial models of truth pit two processes (e.g., fluency and knowledge) against each other.Modeling three or more simultaneous cues could reveal higher-order heuristics (e.g., tallying, take-the-best).},

  comment    = {overview:
- combines survey and web traffic data (YouGov Pulse sample) during the 2016 US presidential campaign
- outcomes of interest: exposure to untrustworthy websites

findings:
1) people diﬀerentially consume false information that reinforces their political view; Trump supporters were most likely to visit untrustworthy websites -> selective exposure
2) but: consumption of news from these sites was instead heavily concentrated among a small subset of people; these sites made up a small share of people’s information diets on average and were largely consumed by a subset of Americans with strong preferences for pro-attitudinal information
3) Facebook played a central role in spreading content from untrustworthy websites relative to other platforms
4) fact-checks of articles published by these outlets almost never reached their target audience
5) untrustworthy website consumption does not crowd out consumption of other hard news
- "These results suggest that widespread speculation about the prevalence of exposure to untrustworthy websites has been overstated." -> I disagree with this point


comments/questions:
- useful citations on selective exposure
- this is another example of downplaying the potential role of fake news in influencing the 2016 election. Argue that previous studies cannot show causal relationship but ignores a lot of issues with their own inference
- url-based approach does not capture fake-news exposure on social media (facebook etc) as long as respondents did not follow each link
- what about weak partisans vs. strong partisans?},

-> "nudging people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve choices about what to share on social media."

questions/comments:
- effectiveness of simple nudge heavily depends on whether the issue is seen as partisan/connected to dientity
- article looks at sharing as an outcome, which is interesting. But: people share due to different reasons! Also, platforms differ with regard to the audience etc. and hence sharing motivations differ across platforms as well -> could be an interesting direction for future studies},

- "The most relevant findings here are that women are significantly more likely to blame the system than are men, and people with more political knowledge perceive fewer systemic influences than those with lower levels of knowledge."
- "People’s blame attributions do shape their attitudes toward the benefits of having women in office," but "these blame attributions are not related to behavior, specifically voting for women candidates."
-> "we find differences among people in the blame explanations they make. These explanations are significantly related to attitudes about women in office but do not influence vote choice decisions when women run for office."},

- survey experiment manipulating the described election outcome in an unidentified state, independently manipulating dyadic (i.e., district-level) vs. collective (i.e., legislature) representation on two dimensions: race and political partisanship
- "citizens prefer collective over dyadic epresentation because collective representation provides better representation of constituents’  interests via substantive and symbolic benefits."

method:

- "short video that summarized documented findings in political science about the efficacy of women as candidates and randomly assigned some participants in an online survey to watch this video"

results:
-> "We find that exposure to information depicting the above-mentioned success of women (relative to men) in terms of garnering both campaign money and votes substantially increased the proportion of respondents who believed that “a male and female candidate stand the same chance of winning” compared to respondents who received no such information"
-> "Thus, our findings suggest that while the chances of women as candidates are not well regarded by the public at large, the promulgation of factual information about the success of female candidates dramatically improves the perceived efficacy of women candidates."

- "Because personal experiences are seen as truer than facts, they furnish the appearance of rationality in opponents, which in turn increases respect"
- "Not all personal experiences are created equal, however. The most effective personal experiences are those that are both relevant to the issue (Study 7) and involve harm---suffering or potential suffering (Study 8)---likely because much of morality is grounded in perceptions of harm (37). It is also important to note that personal experiences only have an ad- vantage in moral disagreement---for agreement (whether moral or nonmoral) and for nonmoral disagreement, facts foster re- spect just as well as experiences (Study 13).'
- Doesn't examine persuasion but focuses on perceived rationality of opponent as key outcome. That could be a bit of a problem though.

Most studies of policy diffusion—which is the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking in other governments—have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the issue-definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our analysis draws upon an original data set of over 52,000 paragraphs from newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames regarding the policy's concrete implications are predicted by prior adoptions in other states, whereas frames regarding its normative justifications are not. Our approach and findings open the way for a new perspective to studying policy diffusion in many different areas.},

  comment   = {overview:
- analysis of multiple CCES waves (2006-2014), examines the effect of women candidates and officeholders on political knowledge, interest, and participation
- main argument: most evidence of the effect of descriptive representation on women's empowerment is drawn from surveys from the 1980s and 1990s
- knoweldge: "both men and women are more politically knowledgeable when represented by women in Congress and in state government."
- engagement: "little evidence that women are more politically interested or participatory when residing in places with more female officeholders or candidates"
-> descriptive representation has modest effects on political knowledge among other women, but little unique benefit specifically for women as gender gaps are not reduced
-> little effect on women's interest or engagement in politics
-> potential explanation: changing trends in how people view gender in campaigns, not particularly salient to how women approach campaigns

questions/comments:
- some useful arguments why we should not expect large effects of descriptive representation in current surveys (as compared to past studies)
- to me, the fact that men are similarly affected by women officeholders than men suggests that there might be some underlying confounding factor that is associated with the likelihood of women candidates},

  year     = {2020},
  comment  = {overview:
- most common design is the between-subjects design in which outcome is only measured post-treatment -> low precision, requires large sample sizes
- alternative designs that involve repeated mesurement of the DV promise greater precision but are rarely used out of fears that the design may bias treatment effects
- this paper shows results form 6 experiments manipulatign designs and shos that repeated measures designs substantially increase precision while introducing little to no bias
- within-subject designs also offer new insights into heterogeneous treatment effects
- interesting finding: most respondents forget their previous response and believe that their opinions did not change in pretest posttest even if they did
- only caveat: within-subject designs are limited to cases in which the effect of the independent variable can be removed
-> "Given the clear gains in precision and weak evidence for bias, we recommend that
researchers use prepost and within-subjects designs whenever possible."

experimental designs considered in the studies:
- posttest -> standard design
- prepost -> standard design + pre-treatment measure (same item)
- quasi-prepost -> standard design + pre-treatment measure (slightly altered item)
- within -> prepost + treatment before first measurement in control (i.e., every group recieves treatment, only ordering of treatments and measurements is varied)

potential sources for bias in repeated measures designs:
- demand effects -> little empirical evidence
- consistency pressures -> limited by subject's memory
- interaction between testing and the treatment -> little evidence?

comments / questions:
- paper also includes some useful discussion regarding the inclusion of covariates to increase precision (which it does, but the benefits are smaller than repeated measurement designs)
-> "While our quasi controls varied in their effectiveness across studies, overall the results suggest that carefully selected controls can substantially increase statistical power relative to standard controls for partisanship and ideology."},

  year       = {2020},
  comment    = {overview:
- contrasting motivated reasoning vs. partisan cheerleading as explanations of political information gaps between partisans
- uses incentives for correct responses: "random assignment of incentives provides insight into the extent to which divides in factual beliefs are inﬂated by partisans knowingly providing incorrect, but party-congenial, answers to the questions"
- "ﬁndings support the motivated reasoning interpretation of misinformation; partisans seek out information with congenial slant and sincerely adopt inaccurate beliefs that cast their party in a favorable light."

design (copy&paste):
1) randomly as- sign survey respondents to either receive or not receive incentives for correctly answering political knowledge questions.
2) respondents selected a news article on the topic to read
3) respondents answered the political information question and also indicated how conﬁdent they were
4) ability to observe the news consumption of some survey respondents outside the survey context

findings:
1) while incentives reduce partisan divides in information, substantial partisan gaps persist even when incentives are present
2) partisans seek out information from co-partisan media sources to the same extent whether incentives are available or not
3) the divides in information search we observe in the survey context mirror partisan divides in online news consumption registered by the same individuals outside the survey setting
-> "Overall, our ﬁndings support motivated reasoning rather than the cheerleading inter- pretation of partisan divides in information and information seeking behavior."

comments:
- useful review of recent research on misinformation, check again for cites and basic arguments
- e.g., "tendencies are complemented by a high-choice information environment that creates an opportunity for partisans to screen out uncongenial information"},

  abstract = {It is often claimed that conspiracy theories are endorsed with the same level of intensity across the left-right ideological spectrum. But do liberals and conservatives in the United States embrace conspiratorial thinking to an equivalent degree? There are important historical, philosophical, and scientific reasons dating back to Richard Hofstadter's book The Paranoid Style in American Politics to doubt this claim. In four large studies of U.S. adults (total N = 5049)—including national samples—we investigated the relationship between political ideology, measured in both symbolic and operational terms, and conspiratorial thinking in general. Results reveal that conservatives in the United States were not only more likely than liberals to endorse specific conspiracy theories, but they were also more likely to espouse conspiratorial worldviews in general (r = .27, 95\% CI: .24, .30). Importantly, extreme conservatives were significantly more likely to engage in conspiratorial thinking than extreme liberals (Hedges' g = .77, SE = .07, p < .001). The relationship between ideology and conspiratorial thinking was mediated by a strong distrust of officialdom and paranoid ideation, both of which were higher among conservatives, consistent with Hofstadter's account of the paranoid style in American politics.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT Does exposure to news affect what people know about politics? This old question attracted new scholarly interest as the political information environment is changing rapidly. In particular, since citizens have new channels at their disposal, such as Twitter and Facebook, which increasingly complement or even replace traditional channels of information. This study investigates to what extent citizens have knowledge about daily politics and to what extent news on social media can provide this knowledge. It does so by means of a large online survey in Belgium (Flanders), in which we measured what people know about current political events, their so-called general surveillance knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that unlike following news via traditional media channels, citizens do not gain more political knowledge from following news on social media. We even find a negative association between following the news on Facebook and political knowledge. We further investigate why this is the case. Our data demonstrate that this lack of learning on social media is not due to a narrow, personalized news diet, as is often suggested. Rather, we find evidence that following news via social media increases a feeling of information overload, which decreases what people actually learn, especially for citizens who combine news via social media with other news sources.},

- several survey experiments on misinformation about crime levels (change in homicide rate etc.)
- misinformation corrections change factual beliefs but have no impact on policy preferences
- instead of corrective information, appeals to group identity lead to persuasion
- 3 group identity treatments: co-partisan elite cues (not effective), group pressure mechanism (effective), out-group perspective-taking (effective)
- "Across six experiments misperceptions of crime are easily corrected, but consistent with prior work, corrections alone never change related policy opinions. Individuals update policy opinions when compelled to consider views of opponents and members of their own race, gender and  political party, but additional corrective facts do little to bolster eﬀects of group-based appeals."

- twitter experiment examining the impact of group norm promotion and social sanctioning on racist online harassment
- twitter users who made racist posts in the past were and who meet certain selection criteria (see paper) were assigned to control vs. 2X2 treatment groups (varying whether the bot was in-group/out-group and high/low follower)
- in the treatment groups, the bots respondend to the racist tweet to suggest that the user should stop harassing others
- main finding: intervention by in-group (i.e., white male) with many followers is effective
- interestingly, user anaonymity has an unexpected effect: the intervention was more effective among users who had more anaonymous twitter accounts},

- this paper evaluates the degree to which respondents who oﬀer incorrect answers to factual questions about politics are misinformed
- the typical incorrect response is stated with substantially less conﬁdence than the typical correct response, and is closer to a coin ﬂip than to incorrect knowledge.
- three-part validation exercise that shows that certainty scales reliably predict accurate responses, response stability, and a measure that reveals respondents’ probabilisic beliefs through costly choices.
- These results highlight a fundamental gap between misinformation in the information environment and research that classiﬁes respondents who answer incorrectly as “misinformed.”

  year      = {2013},
  pages     = {1--20},
  comment   = {overview:
- argues for comprehensive but non-binding registration of designs that goes beyond prior identification of DVs and IVs but includes specific coding choices, model specifications etc. (i.e., "mock report")
- nonbinding registration plays an important communication function independent of any commitment benefits -> benefits from registration can still be achieved even with an imperfect compliance mechanism and with voluntary mechanisms because readers can conition interpretations of findings on whether there was registration and/or compliance
-> registration serves as a communication mechanism rather than a commitment mechanism

definition of fishing:
- a model is fished when the decision to report the model ddepends on the realization of the conclusion -> selecting what results get reported can induce bias
- the problem of fishing is not constrained to selective reporting, but  can occur in multiple stages: analysis, discussions, submissions, attention
- chances of false positives are increased by: number of outcome measures, seloection of covariates, analyzing subgroups, dichotomizing outcome variables, model selection...

consequences of pre-registration / mock report:
- loss of latitude with regard to precise definition of dependent variables and choices over dichotomization, selection of covariates, subgroup analysis, how to summarize results etc.
-> making these detailed decisions prior to data collection helps identify flaws and gaps in measure design before it's too late

with pre-registration, there are 3 sorts of results:
1. those that were executed according to predetermined specifications
2. those registered and that deviated on grounds that may be defended by researchers
3. those that were not preregistered at all and for that reason should be interpreted as speculative

elements of their proposal:
1. Scope: Preregistration is adopted as a norm at least for all experimental and observational research that (a) claims to provide a test of a theory or hypothesis and (b) employs data not available to researchers at the time of registration;
2. Comprehensiveness: Preregistration of key tests should be comprehensive in the sense of providing full analysis plans, for example, in the form of mock tables or through the submission of mock data and analysis code; interpretations of patterns of findings should be included in registration insofar as possible;
3. Deviations: Deviations from registered plans should not preclude publication but should be indicated by authors; differences between results from the modified plans and the registered plans should be reported where possible;
4. Incentives'. The registry or registries should be housed by a third party; leading journals in the discipline should "recognize" the registry and provide recognition for research that is registry compliant;
5. Maintenance'. In addition to providing a repository function, a registry should also be managed: it should ensure that basic criteria are met and maintain records of summary re sults of analyses, including a recording of whether the research was successfully undertaken in the first place.

questions/comments:
- a lot of the suggestions developed by the authors have been implemented by now, many articles report pre-registrations, several journals accept pre-registered report prior to collecting the data.},

- framework (and software) to declare research designs prior to collecting the data or conducting the analysis
- MIDA: causal Model, Inquiry, Data strategy, Answer strategy
- diagnostic statistic: a summary statistic generated from a run of a design (e.g., difference between estimated and actual average treatement effect, or significance at 5% level)
- diagnosand: summary of the distribution of diagnostic statistics (e.g., expected bias etc.)
- authors discuss several possible diagnosands (beyond power!), their usefulness depends on the respective research question etc.
- a design is "diagnosand-complete" for a given diagnosand if that diagnosand can be calculated from the declared design
- interesting example: a 3 arm design can be better than a 2X2 if the interaction effect is relatively weak and the researcher is more interested in the main effects
- "Declaration of these features in code provides sufﬁcient information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal inferences, and other 'diagnosands.'"

Experiment 1: Exposure to Non-Political News
- "The ﬁrst experiment assigns exposure to non-political coverage from an out-party or in-party source, which improves views of out-party media, but has limited eﬀects for those encountering an in-party source."

Experiment 2: Effects of Cross-Cutting News Exposure
- "The second experiment shows cross-cutting exposure reduces oppositional media hostility only when it counters stereotypes of out-party news (i.e., when it is not political or oﬀers a neutral portrayal of ongoing political events)."

Experiment 3: Effects of Cross-Cutting Political News
- "Finally, the third experiment examines how people assess out-party media coverage. Along with others (Feldman 2011, Baum and Gussin 2007, Turner 2007), we ﬁnd partisans engage in biased processing of news from out-party media, but show this is not powerful enough to completely inhibit responsiveness to the type of news these sources provide."},

  pages   = {1--23},
  comment = {overview:
- misperceptions are usually defined as firmly held incorrect beliefs
- paper shows that conditional on self-reported certainty, incorrect responses are less stable over time than correct responses
- this implies that many misperceptions are more accurately characterized as miseducated guesses
- "survey-based research on misperceptions and misinformed beliefs is often characterized by a large conceptual-empirical gap, regardless of whether the quantities of interest are descriptive, causally identified, or somewhere inbetween."
- intervention: frame of reference training corrects self-reported certainty to more accurately capture belief stability

suggested best practices for research in this area:
1) research should offer hard evidence of construct validity (in this paper 90% of certainty was required for modest stability)
2) theoretical expectations about which subgroups hold the deepest misperceptions should not be substitute for hard evidence
3) validity evidence should be question specific

-> key implication: always include certainty measures when measuring misperceptions!

questions / comments:
- the whole argument is based on the finding that measured misperceptions were less stable than measured knowledge. I believe that that is the case, but I'm not sure it necessarily implies such strong conclusions that they should be seen as ignorance of inconvenient thruths rather than congenial falsehoods. For instance, the author's results suggest that climate change misinformation has the largest instability. Does he really mean to suggest that climate change denial is an issue of simple ignorance?},

"The ﬁrst property [of open-ended responses] is what we call the familiarity property. Studies have shown that responses to open-ended questions are inﬂuenced by the respondent’s familiarity with and interest in the subject (Geer 1988, 1991; Holland and Christian 2009). The more familiar a respondent is with a discourse, the higher the likelihood that the respondent will provide a meaningful answer to a question on that discourse."

- survey of 2,300 American Twitter users, linking survey responses to scraped twitter content (with focus on fake news sharing)
- "mapping of psychological proﬁles of over 2,300 American Twitter users linked to behavioral sharing data and sentiment analyses of more than 500,000 news story headlines"
-> "The ﬁndings contradict the ignorance perspective but provide some support for the disruption perspective and strong support for the partisan polarization perspective. Thus, individuals who report hating their political opponents are the most likely to share political fake news and selectively share content that is useful for derogating these opponents."

3 different theories of individual-level motivations for fake news sharing:
1) Ignorance theory: "we test the ignorance theory by focusing on four individual-level predictors of fake news sharing on Twitter: age, cognitive reﬂection, factual political knowledge, and digital literacy."
2) Polarization theory: "we examine whether Democratic partisans are willing to share politically congruent fake news from *pro*-Democratic sources or if the partisanship asymmetry identiﬁed by Guess, Nagler and Tucker (2019) and others prevails."
3) Disruption theory: "we provide the ﬁrst behavioral test of this theory and zoom in on two individual diﬀerences as predictors of fake news sharing: a psychological measure of trolling behavior and a measure of political cynicism."

  comment   = {overview:
- discussion of Reifler/Nyhan paper on backfire effects and how it has been misinterpreted
- great lit review & citations! check again for misinfo discussion project
- "Given these realities, the primary challenge for scientiﬁc communication is not to prevent backﬁre effects but instead, to understand how to tar- get corrective information better and to make it more effective. Ultimately, however, the best approach is to disrupt the forma- tion of linkages between group identities and false claims and to reduce the ﬂow of cues reinforcing those claims from elites and the media. Doing so will require a shift from a strategy focused on providing information to the public to one that consid- ers the roles of intermediaries in forming and maintaining belief systems."
- " The persistence of misperceptions, I argue, is more likely to be attributable to a failure to reach people with corrective information that durably changes their mind."

Potential explanations for misperceptions persistence:
- expressive responding
- decay effects and cues from political elites
- failures in targeting corrective information (!)
-> "expressive survey responses do not seem to play a major role, whereas over-time decay in the effects of corrective information, problems in targeting it to people who consume misinformation, ongoing ﬂows of misperception-enhancing cues from political elites, and failures in cognitive ability and processing effort all seem to be signiﬁcant factors."

Alternative strategies for reducing misperceptions:
- Minimize Elite Misinformation and Partisan Cues
- Make Corrections Harder to Avoid or Deny
- An Intermediary-Focused Approach to Fighting False Beliefs},

Key questions of measurement:
- **What counts?** There are many concepts that we can measure. We must be clear about the ideas, values, priorities and principles that are guiding our selection of research questions and how we frame a topic as worthy of study. 
- **What is the temporal, spatial, structural and cultural integrity of the measure?** Ostensibly similar constructs can be measured in very different ways and the same measure can change over time as the system measuring it changes, or be inconsistent across geographic, demographic, and cultural groups. 
- **Who is counted?** Who opts into the use of various systems such as social media platforms is not random, and nor is what parts of those systems they use and how actively. Accordingly, the trace data of users of such systems that form the basis of many studies may not generalize to the broader population, or even to other, seemingly similar, platforms. 
- **What is accessible to counting?** Science is limited by who is allowed access to what data. The data are limited by the functions, purposes, and protocols of the organizations and technologies that produce them. These limits will never be fully resolved and thus should be a central concern for the field. 
- **What is ethical to count?** Digital data touch many more people than ever before and information can be gleaned about the people not only in a study but around those in the study. This issue of informational spillover is intrinsic in a networked world for all research, which undermines the foundational principle of individual autonomy in current ethical frameworks for research, and greatly increases the duties of researchers to maintain data security. The standards and practices for consent, privacy and confidentiality must take these realities into account.},

  abstract = {Abstract Social scientists are interested in the effects of low-dimensional latent treatments within texts, such as the effect of an attack on a candidate in a political advertisement. We provide a framework for causal inference with latent treatments in high-dimensional interventions. Using this framework, we show that the randomization of texts alone is insufficient to identify the causal effects of latent treatments, because other unmeasured treatments in the text could confound the measured treatment's effect. We provide a set of assumptions that is sufficient to identify the effect of latent treatments and a set of strategies to make these assumptions more plausible, including explicitly adjusting for potentially confounding text features and nontraditional experimental designs involving many versions of the text. We apply our framework to a survey experiment and an observational study, demonstrating how our framework makes text-based causal inferences more credible.},

  comment   = {overview:
- in-person discussion experiment: political conversations reduce affective polarization
- theoretical argument: contact theory, people (falsely) asusme that out-partisans are extreme etc (due to media coverage), but then they see that they actually have things in common, are moderate etc.

theoretical mechanisms:
- awareness of common ground
- perspective-taking
- feeling respected by those from the other party

main findings: 
- discussions in het groups reduce affective polarization and these effects are long lasting (one week)
- discussions in h heterogeneous groups increases willinginess for future discussions (virtuous circle argument)

comments:
- main issue: the authors not only manipulate discussion heterogeneity, but also the discussion prompt. Is this really a discussion effect per se?
- very useful lit review, also discusses how people choose conversation partners based on sociodemgraphic characteristics rather than ideology.
- some discussion of online vs. inperson discussions. check the cites here!
- good example of how to justify (in terms of writing) research design that has some flaws},

  volume    = {59},
  comment   = {overview:
- representative national sample of over 1000 Americans reporting participation in chat rooms and online message boards
- the potential for deliberation (and cross-cutting exposure) occurs primarily in online groups where politics comes up only incidentally, but is not the central purpose of the discussion space
- selection into discussion groups increases homophily, but no evidence for selective exposure to homogenous groups based on partisanship etc.

RQs:
- What proportion of online discussion groups involves political chat rooms or message boards? about 10%
- Does political talk occur in online chat rooms that are established for non-political purposes? Yes
- Are people only exposed to like-minded views or also challenging views? There is exposure to disagreement, especially in chat rooms focused on leisure
- What is the role of partisan-based selective exposure? Selection into political groups creates homophily, but partisanship does not increase selection into homogeneous discussions in non-political chat rooms

=> p.50: "Using a representative sample of chat room and message board users, we find evidence of both the feared reinforcement of like-minded political perspectives online, but also some promising political discussion in groups organized around nonpolitical topics. Internet users who are not sufficiently engaged in politics to self- select into explicitly political online chat rooms or message boards inadvertently encounter political views online in hobby and interest groups in particular. This finding suggests that differentiating between the political and apolitical uses of the Internet is apparently not as clear cut as it first seems. "},

  comment   = {overview:
- author argues that we need to distinguish b/w uncivil (pure tone, independent of content, context-depedent) and intolerant (undemocratic etc.) messaging
- Uncivil discourse: people express themselves with foul language or harsh tone
- Intolerant discourse, where individuals or groups are attacked in ways that violate moral respect and threaten democratic pluralism
- incivility is not necessarily bad for poltical talk or discourse, since people are still exposed to different views. Furthermore, incivility can lead to subseqeutn engagement
- Method: manual coding of comments on Facebook vs. newspaper website in Brazil

Hypotheses (not all are supported):
H1a: There is a positive relationship between disagreement and uncivil messages.
H1b: There is a negative relationship between disagreement and intolerant messages.
H2: Comments will be more uncivil on news websites than on Facebook.
H3: Comments will be less intolerant on news websites than on Facebook.
H4: Incivility is positively associated with justified opinion expression.
RQ1: What is the relationship between justified opinion expres- sion and intolerance?

By implicitly associating the political to male-oriented issues and male-dominated actors and domains, it artificially amplifies the gender gap, particularly by depressing women’s reported interest. The first experiment captures respondents’ interest through both the standard question about general political interest and a battery of specific political issues, randomizing question order. In the second experiment, an additional text helps reformulate the standard question by prompting respondents to think about politics in broader terms, randomizing the presentation of male-oriented and female-oriented political issues to test the effect of cognitive accessibility and recency. By expanding the conceptualization of the political, the priming applied in our experiments completely closes the gender gap, thereby casting doubt on the validity of the traditional survey instrument.}},

  comment   = {Overview:
- analysis of delibertive polling data to examine 3 types of deliberative distortions (i.e., moving attitudes away from what they would hold with the benefit of unlimited information and thought): (1) ‘homogenize’ attitudes (decreasing their variance), (2) ‘polarize’ them (moving their means toward the nearer extreme), or (3) engender ‘domination’ (moving their overall means toward those of the attitudes held by the socially advantaged)
- "Reassuringly, the results show no routine or strong homogenization, polarization, or domination. What little pattern there is suggests some faint homogenization, but also some faint moderation (as opposed to polarization) and opposition (as opposed to domination)--all as is to be expected when the outside-world forces shaping pre-deliberation attitudes are slightly more centrifugal than centripetal."

Comments:
- only read front-end and skimmed the results...
- theory/idea of domination as an observable implication is interesting if one wants to move away from only looking at polarization etc. as standard outcomes.},

  abstract  = {Although strategies exist to measure actors' efforts to set policy, media, and lawmaking agendas, political scientists lack a method for identifying and accurately measuring another form of agenda setting that lies under the surface anytime two people talk. Within interactions, such as debates, deliberations, and discussions, actors can set the agenda by shifting others' attention to their preferred topics. In this article, I use a topic model that locates where topic shifts occur within an interaction in order to measure the relative agenda-setting power of actors. Validation exercises show that the model accurately identifies topic shifts and infers coherent topics. Three empirical applications also validate the agenda-setting measure within different political settings: U.S. presidential debates, in-person deliberations, and online discussions. These applications show that successfully setting the agenda can shape an interaction's outcomes, demonstrating the importance of continued research on this form of agenda setting.},
  comment   = {Overview:
- SITS (Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation): variation of LDA topic model that locates where topic shifts occur within an interaction in order to measure the relative agenda-setting power of actors.
- estimate three sets of latent quantities of interest: What topics are on the agenda, where shifts in the agenda occur, and each actor’s agenda-setting power
- agenda-setting measure is a speaker-level quantity. It describes the propensity of a speaker to shift topic when speaking

Validation:
- "I present results from three validation exercises. The first exercise provides evidence that SITS can accurately identify where latent shifts in the agenda occur. Second, using crowdsourced human judgments, I validate that SITS can infer semantically meaningful latent topics. Finally, I assess the interre- lated nature of where shifts in topic occur and the topics themselves by examining the resulting segments of an interaction. Using crowdsourced human judgments, I find that SITS segments are viewed as more coherent than segments derived from a hand-coding approach."

Applications:
- "First, with U.S. presidential debates, I show that SITS can be used to test theories about the topics actors should favor in electoral debates. Second, using in-person deliberations, I shift emphasis from the topical agenda to who can set the agenda. I validate that participants who SITS identifies as setting the agenda indeed shift attention to their ideas, and do not do so by simply interrupting or out-talking others. And third, using a novel online discussion study, I show that agenda setting can shape the outcomes of political interactions."},

Scholars working in this area have proposed various explanations for this phenomenon, often focusing on issues regarding the format and content of factual knowledge batteries. Yet, there are surprisingly few works that focus on how scholars might diversify the content of political knowledge measures to develop items that are less biased toward male areas of expertise. In this paper, we propose an inductive framework to develop more gender-balanced knowledge batteries by including political issues that are of particular relevance to women and women’s lives. Employing gender-balanced measures of political knowledge reveal instances where women and men demonstrate equivalent levels of political knowledge and higher levels of political interest and efficacy among women—engagement that is often masked by conventional measures of knowledge.},

- examines knowledge questions in the CSES from 106 postelection surveys in 47 countries
- 3 main sources of knowledge inequalities: gender, age, education
- 3 attributes of knowledge questions: content (e.g., party position, gender-relevant), format (T/F, multiple choice, open), and object (number, name, word), differentiates b/w DK and incorrect response
- types of questions impact the size of the knowledge gaps, but *object* does not affect gender gap -> shows that gender gap is different from age/education gap, more likely due to measurement
- "shows that gender gap is different from age/education gap, more likely due to measurement"
	
Recommendations for knowledge questions:
- "Surveys aspiring to measure citizens’ knowledge about the political world in a valid manner should include items inquiring about different substantive contents, and not only elections or partisan politics as the available postelectoral surveys around the world currently do."
- Close-ended format with at least four possible options

Comments / Questions:
- useful lit review and cites
- question *object* results not so interesting empirically, but the theoretical argument regarding the underlying cognitive abilities needed to provide a correct answer is useful},

  abstract = {Abstract Political scientists frequently interpret the results of conjoint experiments as reflective of majority preferences. In this article, we show that the target estimand of conjoint experiments, the average marginal component effect (AMCE), is not well defined in these terms. Even with individually rational experimental subjects, the AMCE can indicate the opposite of the true preference of the majority. To show this, we characterize the preference aggregation rule implied by the AMCE and demonstrate its several undesirable properties. With this result, we provide a method for placing bounds on the proportion of experimental subjects who prefer a given candidate feature. We describe conditions under which the AMCE corresponds in sign with the majority preference. Finally, we offer a structural interpretation of the AMCE and highlight that the problem we describe persists even when a model of voting is imposed.},

  year      = {2022},
  comment   = {Overview:
- paper develops important recommendations for research design that study misinformation (interventions)
- different design choices imply different normative claims about the effectiveness of misinformation interventions. Authors argue that the normative claim that citizens should maximize the accuracy of the content they believe and share suggests a specific set of design choices.
- standard designs often focus on belief in fake news alone, the issue here is that such a design conflates the propensity to believe and share false content with the propensity to believe and share *all* content.

Recommendations:
1) designs should include both true and false content!
2) anlysis should include examining discernment between belief in true vs. false information
3) discernment should be measured in terms of proportion (multiplicative discernment, i.e., false/true) rather than additive discernments (false-true), which can be easily done using a logit link. Ideally examine effects on both (as separate dvs) and then examine effects on true and false headlines separately to evaluate which side is driving the effects.
- "By taking these baseline differences into account, multiplicative discernment reflects differences in the ability of individuals to discern between true and false news–the stated goal of many misinformation studies. As additive discernment does not take these baseline differences into account, it reflects differences in the total amount of true news shared related to false news."

Questions/Comments:
- great paper, makes a really important point.
- minor critique: following their logic, a useful intervention could consist of encouraging everyone to believe everything, since there's more true news out there than fake news.},

- survey experiment examining the effect of misinformation (and corrections) with a focus on Latino populations in the US.
- main findings: "In a pre-registered experiment, we find that exposure to misinformation can decrease factual accuracy, and neither trust in nor consumption of media, including ethnic media, serve as a buffer against these misinformation effects. However, fact-checks improve factual accuracy among subgroups varying in levels of political knowledge, trust, and acculturation."
- In short corrections are effective, there's a bit of treatment effect heterogeneity, but nothing that eliminates the correction impact.
- nice touch: replicates other experimental findings to address concern about sample quality (Lucid etc).},

Much of the anomalous response problem has been traced to India, and several survey and technological techniques have been developed to detect foreign workers accessing US-specific surveys. We survey Indian MTurkers and find that 26% pass survey questions used to detect foreign workers, and 3% claim to be located in the United States. We show that restricting respondents to Master Workers and removing the US location requirement encourages Indian MTurkers to correctly self-report their location, helping to reduce anomalous responses among US respondents and to improve data quality. Based on these results, we outline key considerations for researchers seeking to maximize data quality while keeping costs low.},

Members od the non-dominant group do not benefit from perspective taking, but would rather respond positively to perspective-giving (expressing oneself and *being heard*)
- being heard was achieved by reading the responders restatement of the sender's original statement.

notes:
- pdf includes supplementary material describing design, definitely check out again for conversation experiments
- interesting: simple essay task (instead of interaction, see study 2 control group) had much smaller/insignificant effects. It's the interaction that matters!},

  comment = {overview:
- experimental design that attempts to create optimal conditions to detect attitude polarization due to motivated reasoning / backlash effects. Still finds no evidence for polarization.
- interesting design component: uses large language model GPT-3 to assign respondents to personalized pro-attitudinal and counter-attitudinal information

components of "critical test" that creates favorable conditions to detect polarization (p.10):
1. **Strong attitudes:** Respondents provide open-ended input about their deeply held attitudes. We validate the strength of these attitudes using multiple measures.
2. **Tailored arguments:** We employ GPT-3 to generate arguments tailored to respondents’ strong attitudes. We test both single-sentence arguments (Experiments 1 and 2) and full paragraphs (Experiment 3).
3. **Motivational primes:** We randomly assign participants to be primed either for directionally motivated reasoning or for accuracy motivations prior to argument exposure in Experiments 1 and 2.
4. **Multiple information conditions:** We randomly assign participants to view and respond to four pro-attitudinal arguments, four counter-attitudinal arguments, or two of each. Past studies have typically included only a Con or a Mixed condition. The Mixed argument condition offers a potential test of the biased assimilation hypothesis à la Lord et al. (1979), while evidence of polarization under Mixed or Con conditions would align with the motivated reasoning view.

- knowledge-based model of the persistence of framing effects
- 3 mediating processes in framing effects: accessibility, applicability, belief content
- accessibility effects are more temporary, applicability and content change have to potential to cause more durable effects
- probability of fleeting / fading / persistent / compound framing effects depends on the chronic accessibility as well as the density of prior knowledge
- low or medium density + low or high chronic accessibility = (potentially) persistent effects

questions/comments:
- extremely useful article, consult again for project with Jenn!
- framing effects are modeled as a function of prior knowledge, but the authors also acknowledge that there are other moderators of persistence, such as depth of processing!
- key measurement challenge (does the frame "leave a trace" in memory?) could be addressed using open-ended responses (are specific keywords mentioned?). In addition prior knowledge on the iswsue could be measured using discursive sophistication.},

- equation balance is a necessary condition for a valid model of time series data. We treat equation balance as a theoretical matter, not merely an empirical one, and describe how to use the concept of balance to test theoretical propositions before longitudinal data have been gathered.
- a model is balanced when the collection of variables on the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation are collectively of the same order of integration as the variable on the left-hand side (LHS).
- For the purposes of estimation, it is also necessary that there is a re-parameterization of the empirical model in which the regressand is I(0) and the equation is balanced (Banerjee et al. 1993,167–168). We call this “I(0) balance.”
- Because violations of balance result in nonstationary residuals, we advocate testing residuals for white noise as an overall test of equation balance},
