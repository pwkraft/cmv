\noindent The American electorate is becoming increasingly polarized. According to
research in moral psychology, these growing disagreements between
liberals and conservatives can be attributed to fundamental differences
in the moral frameworks that shape individual ideology. Indeed, scholars
suggest that ideologues would be more likely to reach compromise if both
sides spoke the same ``moral language.'' While this implicit assumption
has intuitive appeal, it remains largely untested empirically. Drawing
on a unique dataset from the online discussion board \emph{Reddit}, this
paper examines how moral appeals can affect individual persuasion and
the likelihood of agreement and consensus building through deliberation.

\noindent \doublespacing Recent years have witnessed a resurgence in partisan polarization in the
United States. Politically engaged citizens hold more diverging policy
views, are more ideologically extreme, and exhibit stronger negative
affect towards out-partisans than in the past
\citep{hetherington2001resurgent, abramowitz2008polarization, iyengar2012affect, mason2014disrespectfully, huddy2015expressive, iyengar2015fear}.
A growing literature in moral psychology---building on Moral Foundations
Theory---attributes this divide (at least partially) to fundamental
differences in moral frameworks that guide liberal and conservative
thinking \citep[c.f.,][]{haidt2012righteous}. According to this
perspective, liberals focus on \emph{individualizing} moral foundations,
which include care/harm and fairness/cheating. Conservatives, on the
other hand, also emphasize the remaining \emph{binding} foundations of
loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation
\citep{haidt2007morality, graham2009liberals}. Differential emphasis on
these moral dimensions is systematically related to attitudes towards a
wide variety of divisive political issues
\citep[e.g.][]{koleva2012tracing, kertzer2014moral, low2015moral},
personality traits like individual social dominance orientation (SDO)
and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) \citep{federico2013mapping}, as
well as voting behavior \citep{franks2015using}. Overall, this body of
research suggests that liberals and conservatives endorse different
moral foundations and that these differences are related to political
attitudes, evaluations, and behavior.

An important implicit assumption that has been made repeatedly in this
literature is that liberals and conservatives would be more likely to
come to agreements \emph{if only they focused on the same moral
foundations}. For example \citet[365]{haidt2012righteous} concludes in
his book \emph{The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by
Politics and Religion}: ``Once people join a political team, they get
ensnared in its moral matrix. They see confirmation of their grand
narrative everywhere, and it's difficult---perhaps impossible---to
convince them that they are wrong \emph{if you argue with them from
outside of their matrix}'' (emphasis added). In an different article,
\citet[1040]{graham2009liberals} contend that their findings ``help
explain \emph{why liberals and conservatives disagree on so many moral
issues} and often find it hard to understand how an ethical person could
hold the beliefs of the other side: Liberals and conservatives
\emph{base their moral values, judgments, and arguments on different
configurations} of the five foundations.'' The underlying assumption
that emphasizing the same foundations can facilitate compromise has
important implications---especially in our current political
environment. Somewhat surprisingly, however, it has never been subjected
to a direct empirical test.

There are reasons to believe that compromise is still difficult---and
potentially even further impeded---if individuals argue on the basis of
the same set of moral foundations. \citet{skitka2005moral}, for example,
provide a different theoretical perspective than MFT by conceptualizing
moralization as a unique feature of attitude strength. According to this
view, moral convictions are perceived as ``absolutes, or universal
standards of truth that others should also share''
\citep[269]{skitka2010psychology}. As such, they combine the following
attributes: they are viewed by individuals as applying to everyone
(universality), they do not require an immediate underlying rationale
but are rather seen as facts about the world (objectivity), they can be
independent of authority and group norms (autonomy), they elicit strong
emotional reactions, and they have an inherent motivational quality
(motivation/justification) \citep{skitka2010psychology}. Building on
this work, \citet{ryan2014reconsidering} argued that moral convictions
are not restricted to issues that are traditionally perceived as
``moral,'' such as abortion or same-sex marriage, but can also include
other issues such as economic policies. The degree of moral conviction
may therefore vary between individuals as well as across issues.
\citet{ryan2014reconsidering} further showed that the propensity to
moralize---i.e.~the tendency to view an issue as a question of ``right
and wrong''---is related to political participation, extreme political
attitudes, arousal of negative emotions, and hostility. In a subsequent
study, \citet{ryan2016no} suggested that moralization as a distinct
characteristic of attitude intensity reorients behavior from maximizing
gains to the general adherence to rules. Across multiple studies, the
author showed that this tendency translates into stronger opposition to
compromise about political issues and decreased support for compromising
politicians. These patterns should also translate into attitudes
towards---and interactions with---others who hold opposing views.
Indeed, moral conviction has been shown to be related to stronger
preferences for social distance from (and hostility towards)
attitudinally dissimilar others and lower cooperativeness in groups
holding heterogeneous views \citep{skitka2005moral}.

Ultimately, both perspectives in moral psychology lead to diverging
expectations regarding the effect of moral appeals on persuasion and the
likelihood of compromise: While moral foundations theory contends that
agreement should be facilitated if two discussants focus on the same
underlying foundations, the moral conviction literature suggests that
any type of moral appeal should make it harder to overcome disagreement.
The present paper tests both competing predictions by analyzing online
discussions on the Reddit community \texttt{/r/ChangeMyView}. The
following section discusses the dataset in more detail.

\section{Description of Dataset}\label{description-of-dataset}

\texttt{ChangeMyView} is a Reddit community where participants begin a
discussion by describing their attitude on a chosen issue in an original
post. Other participants are invited to challenge the original author's
arguments and opinions in order to change his or her mind about the
issue. For example, an original post could start ``cmv: iran has the
right to develop nuclear weapons.''

\citet{tan2016winning} analyzed the discussion dynamics on ChangeMyView

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

The preliminary results are consistent with the literature on moral
conviction and clearly contradict the implicit assumptions made in the
Moral Foundations literature. Overall, arguments that revolve around the
same moral foundations are less likely to be persuasive. In most cases,
moral appeals of any type appear counterproductive in facilitating
compromise and changing people's minds.
